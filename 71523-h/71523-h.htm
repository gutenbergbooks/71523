<p class="ph2">HISTORY OF MY PETS.</p>

<hr class="tiny">
<h2 class="nobreak">KETURAH, THE CAT.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first pet, in whose history you
would take any interest, came into my
possession when I was about nine years
old. I remember the day as plainly
as I remember yesterday. I was going
home from school, very sad and out of humor
with myself, for I had been marked
deficient in Geography, and had gone
down to the very foot in the spelling-class.
On the way I was obliged to pass
a little old log-house, which stood near
the road, and which I generally ran by
in a great hurry, as the woman who lived
there had the name of being a scold and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
a sort of a witch. She certainly was a
stout, ugly woman, who drank a great
deal of cider, and sometimes beat her husband,—which
was very cruel, as he was
a mild, little man, and took good care of
the baby while she went to mill. But
that day I trudged along carelessly and
slowly, for I was too unhappy to be afraid,
even of that dreadful woman. Yet I
started, and felt my heart beat fast, when
she called out to me. “Stop, little girl!”
she said; “don’t you want this ’ere
young cat?” and held out a beautiful
white kitten. I ran at once and caught
it from her hands, thanking her as well
as I could, and started for home, carefully
covering pussy’s head with my pinafore,
lest she should see where I took her,
and so know the way back. She was
rather uneasy, and scratched my arms a
good deal;—but I did not mind that, I
was so entirely happy in my new pet.
When I reached home, and my mother
looked more annoyed than pleased with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
the little stranger, and my father and
brothers would take no particular notice
of her, I thought they must be very hard-hearted
indeed, not to be moved by her
beauty and innocence. My brother William,
however, who was very obliging, and
quite a mechanic, made a nice little house,
or “cat-cote,” as he called it, in the back-yard,
and put in it some clean straw for
her to lie on. I then gave her a plentiful
supper of new milk, and put her to bed
with my own hands. It was long before
I could sleep myself that night, for thinking
of my pet. I remember I dreamed
that little angels came to watch over me,
as I had been told they would watch over
good children, but that, when they came
near to my bedside, they all turned into
white kittens and purred over my sleep.</p>

<p>The next morning, I asked my mother
for a name for pussy. She laughed and
gave me “Keturah,”—saying that it was
a good Sunday name, but that I might
call her Kitty, for short.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>Soon, I am happy to say, all the family
grew to liking my pet very much, and I
became exceedingly fond and proud of
her. Every night when I returned from
school, I thought I could see an improvement
in her, till I came to consider her a
kitten of prodigious talent. I have seen
many cats in my day, and I still think that
Keturah was very bright. She could perform
a great many wonderful exploits,—such
as playing hide and seek with me, all
through the house, and lying on her back
perfectly still, and pretending to be dead.
I made her a little cloak, cap, and bonnet,
and she would sit up straight, dressed in
them, on a little chair, for all the world
like some queer old woman. Once, after
I had been to the menagerie, I made her a
gay suit of clothes, and taught her to ride
my brother’s little dog, as I had seen the
monkey ride the pony. She, in her turn,
was very fond of me, and would follow me
whenever she could.</p>

<p>It happened that when Kitty was about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
a year old, and quite a sizable cat, I became
very much interested in some religious
meetings which were held on every
Wednesday evening in the village church,
about half a mile from our house. I
really enjoyed them very much, for I
loved our minister, who was a good and
kind man, and I always felt a better and
happier child after hearing him preach,
even though I did not understand all that
he said. One evening it chanced that
there were none going from our house;
but my mother, who saw that I was sadly
disappointed, gave me leave to go with a
neighbouring family, who never missed a
meeting of the sort. But when I reached
Deacon Wilson’s, I found that they were
already gone. Yet, as it was not quite
dark, I went on by myself, intending, if I
did not overtake them, to go directly to
their pew. I had not gone far before I
found Kitty at my heels. I spoke as
crossly as I could to her, and sent her
back,—looking after her till she was out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
of sight. But just as I reached the
church, she came bounding over the fence,
and went trotting along before me. Now,
what could I do? I felt that it would be
very wicked to take a cat to meeting, but
I feared that, if I left her outside, she
might be lost, or stolen, or killed. So I
took her up under my shawl, and went
softly into church. I dared not carry her
to Deacon Wilson’s pew, which was just
before the pulpit, but sat down in the farther
end of the first slip, behind a pillar,
and with nobody near.</p>

<p>I was very sorry to find that it was
not our handsome, young minister that
preached, but an old man and a stranger.
His sermon may have been a fine one, for
the grown-up people, but it struck me as
rather dull. I had been a strawberrying
that afternoon, and was sadly tired,—and
the cat in my lap purred so drowsily, that
I soon found my eyes closing, and my head
nodding wisely to every thing the minister
said. I tried every way to keep awake,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
but it was of no use. I finally fell asleep,
and slept as soundly as I ever slept in my
life.</p>

<p>When I awoke at last, I did not know
where I was. All was dark around me,
and there was the sound of rain without.
The meeting was over, the people had
all gone, without having seen me, and I
was alone in the old church at midnight!</p>

<p>As soon as I saw how it was, I set up
a great cry, and shrieked and called at
the top of my voice. But nobody heard
me,—for the very good reason that nobody
lived anywhere near. I will do Kitty
the justice to say, that she showed no fear
at this trying time, but purred and rubbed
against me, as much as to say,—“Keep
a good heart, my little mistress!”</p>

<p>O, ’twas a dreadful place in which to
be, in the dark night!—There, where I
had heard such awful things preached
about, before our new minister came, who
loved children too well to frighten them
but who chose rather to talk about our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
good Father in Heaven, and the dear
Saviour, who took little children in his
arms and blessed them. I thought of
Him then, and when I had said my
prayers I felt braver, and had courage
enough to go and try the doors; but all
were locked fast. Then I sat down and
cried more bitterly than ever, but Kitty
purred cheerfully all the time.</p>

<p>At last I remembered that I had seen
one of the back-windows open that evening,—perhaps
I might get out through
that. So I groped my way up the broad
aisle, breathing hard with awe and fear.
As I was passing the pulpit, there came a
clap of thunder which jarred the whole
building, and the great red Bible, which
lay on the black velvet cushions of the
desk, fell right at my feet! I came near
falling myself, I was so dreadfully scared;
but I made my way to the window, which
I found was open by the rain beating
in. But though I stretched myself up
on tiptoe, I could not quite reach the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
sill. Then I went back by the pulpit
and got the big Bible, which I placed on
the floor edgeways against the wall, and
by that help I clambered to the window.
I feared I was a great sinner to make
such use of the Bible, and such a splendid
book too, but I could not help it. I
put Kitty out first, and then swung myself
down. It rained a little, and was so
dark that I could see nothing but my
white kitten, who ran along before me,
and was both a lantern and a guide. I
hardly know how I got home, but there I
found myself at last. All was still, but I
soon roused the whole house; for, when
the danger and trouble were over, I cried
the loudest with fright and cold. My
mother had supposed that Deacon Wilson’s
family had kept me for the night, as
I often stayed with them, and had felt no
anxiety for me.</p>

<p>Dear mother!—I remember how she
took off my dripping clothes, and made
me some warm drink, and put me snugly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
to bed, and laughed and cried, as she
listened to my adventures, and kissed me
and comforted me till I fell asleep. Nor
was Kitty forgotten, but was fed and put
as cosily to bed as her poor mistress.</p>

<p>The next morning I awoke with a
dreadful headache, and when I tried to
rise I found I could not stand. I do not
remember much more, except that my father,
who was a physician, came and felt
my pulse, and said I had a high fever,
brought on by the fright and exposure of
the night previous. I was very sick indeed
for three or four weeks, and all that
time my faithful Kitty stayed by the side
of my bed. She could be kept out of the
room but a few moments during the day,
and mewed piteously when they put her in
her little house at night. My friends said
that it was really very affecting to see her
love and devotion; but I knew very little
about it, as I was out of my head, or in a
stupor, most of the time. Yet I remember
how the good creature frolicked about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
me the first time I was placed in an arm-chair,
and wheeled out into the dining-room
to take breakfast with the family;
and when, about a week later, my brother
Charles took me in his strong arms and
carried me out into the garden, how she
ran up and down the walks, half crazy
with delight, and danced along sideways,
and jumped out at us from behind currant-bushes,
in a most cunning and startling
manner.</p>

<p>I remember now how strange the garden
looked,—how changed from what I
had last seen it. The roses were all, all
gone, and the China-asters and marigolds
were in bloom. When my brother passed
with me through the corn and beans, I
wondered he did not get lost, they were
grown so thick and high.</p>

<p>It was in the autumn after this sickness,
that one afternoon I was sitting under the
shade of a favorite apple-tree, reading Mrs.
Sherwood’s sweet story of “Little Henry
and his Bearer.” I remember how I cried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
over it, grieving for poor Henry and his
dear teacher. Ah, I little thought how
soon my tears must flow for myself and my
Kitty! It was then that my sister came
to me, looking sadly troubled, to tell me
the news. Our brother William, who was
a little mischievous, had been amusing
himself by throwing Kitty from a high
window, and seeing her turn somersets
in the air, and alight on her feet unhurt.
But at last, becoming tired or dizzy,
she had fallen on her back and broken
the spine, just below her shoulders.
I ran at once to where she lay on the turf,
moaning in her pain. I sat down beside
her, and cried as though my heart would
break. There I stayed till evening, when
my mother had Kitty taken up very gently,
carried into the house, and laid on a
soft cushion. Then my father carefully
examined her hurt. He shook his head,
said she could not possibly get well, and
that she should be put out of her misery
at once. But I begged that she might be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
allowed to live till the next day. I did
not eat much supper that night, or breakfast
in the morning, but grieved incessantly
for her who had been to me a fast friend
in sickness as in health.</p>

<p>About nine o’clock of a pleasant September
morning, my brothers came and
held a council round poor Kitty, who was
lying on a cushion in my lap, moaning
with every breath; and they decided
that, out of pity for her suffering, they
must put her to death. The next question
was, how this was to be done. “Cut
her head off with the axe!” said my
brother Charles, trying to look very manly
and stern, with his lip quivering all the
while. But my brother William, who
had just been reading a history of the
French Revolution, and how they took
off the heads of people with a machine
called the guillotine, suggested that the
straw-cutter in the barn would do the
work as well, and not be so painful for
the executioner. This was agreed to by
all present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>Weeping harder than ever, I then took
a last leave of my dear pet, my good
and loving and beautiful Kitty. They
took her to the guillotine, while I ran and
shut myself up in a dark closet, and stopped
my ears till they came and told me
that all was over.</p>

<p>The next time I saw my poor pet, she
was lying in a cigar-box, ready for burial.
They had bound her head on very cleverly
with bandages, and washed all the blood
off from her white breast; clover-blossoms
were scattered over her, and a green
sprig of catnip was placed between her
paws. My youngest brother, Albert, drew
her on his little wagon to the grave, which
was dug under a large elm-tree, in a corner
of the yard. The next day I planted
over her a shrub called the “pussy-willow.”</p>

<p>After that I had many pet kittens, but
none that ever quite filled the place of
poor Keturah. Yet I still have a great
partiality for the feline race. I like nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
better than to sit, on a summer afternoon
or in a winter evening, and watch the
graceful gambols and mischievous frolics
of a playful kitten.</p>

<p>For some weeks past we have had with
us on the sea-shore a beautiful little Virginian
girl,—one of the loveliest creatures
alive,—who has a remarkable fondness
for a pretty black and white kitten, belonging
to the house. All day long she will
have her pet in her arms, talking to her
when she thinks nobody is near,—telling
her every thing,—charging her to keep
some story to herself, as it is a very great secret,—sometimes
reproving her for faults,
or praising her for being good. Her last
thought on going to sleep, and the first
on waking, is this kitten. She loves her
so fondly, that her father has promised
that she shall take her all the way to Virginia.
We shall miss the frolicsome kitten
much, but the dear child far more.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SAM, THE COCKEREL.</h2>
</div>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_p017.jpg" alt="decorative line"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next pet which I remember to
have had was a handsome cockerel, as
gay and gallant a fellow as ever scratched
up seed-corn, or garden-seeds, for the
young pullets.</p>

<p>Sam was a foundling; that is, he was
cast off by an unnatural mother, who,
from the time he was hatched, refused to
own him. In this sad condition my father
found him, and brought him to me.
I took and put him in a basket of wool,
where I kept him most of the time, for a
week or two, feeding him regularly and
taking excellent care of him. He grew
and thrived, and finally became a great
house-pet and favorite. My father was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
especially amused by him, but my mother,
I am sorry to say, always considered him
rather troublesome, or, as she remarked,
“more plague than profit.” Now I think
of it, it must have been rather trying to
have had him pecking at a nice loaf of
bread, when it was set down before the
fire to raise, and I don’t suppose that the
print of his feet made the prettiest sort of
a stamp for cookies and pie-crust.</p>

<p>Sam was intelligent, very. I think I
never saw a fowl turn up his eye with
such a cunning expression after a piece of
mischief. He showed such a real affection
for me, that I grew excessively fond of
him. But ah, I was more fond than wise!
Under my doting care, he never learnt to
roost like other chickens. I feared that
something dreadful might happen to him
if he went up into a high tree to sleep;
so when he grew too large to lie in his
basket of wool, I used to stow him away
very snugly in a leg of an old pair of pantaloons,
and lay him in a warm place under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
a corner of the wood-house. In the
morning I had always to take him out;
and as I was not, I regret to say, a very
early riser, the poor fellow never saw daylight
till two or three hours after all the
other cocks in the neighbourhood were up
and crowing.</p>

<p>After Sam was full-grown, and had a
“coat of many colors” and a tail of gay
feathers, it was really very odd and laughable
to see how every evening, just at sundown,
he would leave all the other fowls
with whom he had strutted and crowed
and fought all day, and come meekly to
me, to be put to bed in the old pantaloons.</p>

<p>But one morning, one sad, dark morning,
I found him strangely still when I
went to release him from his nightly confinement.
He did not flutter, nor give a
sort of smothered crow, as he usually did.
The leg of which I took hold to pull him
out, seemed very cold and stiff. Alas, he
had but one leg! Alas, he had no head
at all! My poor Sam had been murdered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
and partly devoured by a cruel rat some
time in the night!</p>

<p>I took the mangled body into the house,
and sat down in a corner with it in my
lap, and cried over it for a long time. It
may seem very odd and ridiculous, but I
really <i>grieved</i> for my dead pet; for I believed
he had loved and respected me as
much as it is in a cockerel’s heart to love
and respect any one. I knew I had loved
him, and I reproached myself bitterly for
never having allowed him to learn to
roost.</p>

<p>At last, my brothers came to me, and
very kindly and gently persuaded me to
let Sam be buried out of my sight. They
dug a little grave under the elm-tree, by
the side of Keturah, laid the body down,
wrapped in a large cabbage-leaf, filled in
the earth, and turfed over the place. My
brother Rufus, who knew a little Latin,
printed on a shingle the words, “<i>Hic jacet
Samuelus</i>,”—which mean, Here lies
Sam,—and placed it above where the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
head of the unfortunate fowl should have
been.</p>

<p>I missed this pet very much; indeed,
every body missed him after he was gone,
and even now I cannot laugh heartily
when I think of the morning when I
found him dead.</p>

<p>A short time after this mournful event,
my brother Rufus, who was something of
a poet, wrote some lines for me, which he
called a “Lament.” This I then thought
a very affecting, sweet, and consoling
poem, but I have since been inclined to
think that my brother was making sport
of me and my feelings all the time. I
found this same “Lament” the other day
among some old papers, and as it is quite
a curiosity, I will let you see it:—</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">TOBY, THE HAWK.</h2>
</div>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_p017.jpg" alt="decorative line"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">About</span> the queerest pet that I ever had
was a young hawk. My brother Rufus,
who was a great sportsman, brought him
home to me one night in spring. He had
shot the mother-hawk, and found this
young half-fledged one in the nest. I received
the poor orphan with joy, for he
was too small for me to feel any horror of
him, though his family had long borne
rather a bad name. I resolved that I
would bring him up in the way he should
go, so that when he was old he should
not destroy chickens. At first, I kept
him in a bird-cage, but after a while he
grew too large for his quarters, and had to
have a house built for him expressly. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
let him learn to roost, but I tried to bring
him up on vegetable diet. I found, however,
that this would not do. He eat the
bread and grain to be sure, but he did not
thrive; he looked very lean, and smaller
than hawks of his age should look. At
last I was obliged to give up my fine idea of
making an innocent dove, or a Grahamite,
out of the poor fellow, and one morning
treated him to a slice of raw mutton. I
remember how he flapped his wings and
cawed with delight, and what a hearty
meal he made of it. He grew very fat
and glossy after this important change in
his diet, and I became as proud of him as
of any pet I ever had. But my mother,
after a while, found fault with the great
quantity of meat which he devoured. She
said that he eat more beef-steak than any
other member of the family. Once, when
I was thinking about this, and feeling a
good deal troubled lest some day, when I
was gone to school, they at home might
take a fancy to cut off the head of my pet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
to save his board-bill, a bright thought
came into my mind. There was running
through our farm, at a short distance
from our house, a large mill-stream, along
the banks of which lived and croaked a
vast multitude of frogs. These animals
are thought by hawks, as well as Frenchmen,
very excellent eating. So, every
morning, noon, and night, I took Toby on
my shoulder, ran down to the mill-stream,
and let him satisfy his appetite on all such
frogs as were so silly as to stay out of the
water and be caught. He was very quick
and active,—would pounce upon a great,
green croaker, and have him halved and
quartered and hid away in a twinkling.
I generally looked in another direction
while he was at his meals,—it is not polite
to keep your eye on people when they
are eating, and then I couldn’t help pitying
the poor frogs. But I knew that
hawks must live, and say what they might,
my Toby never prowled about hen-coops
to devour young chickens. I taught him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
better morals than that, and kept him so
well fed that he was never tempted to such
wickedness. I have since thought that, if
we want people to do right, we must treat
them as I treated my hawk; for when we
think a man steals because his heart is
full of sin, it may be only because his
stomach is empty of food.</p>

<p>When Toby had finished his meal,
he would wipe his beak with his wing,
mount on my shoulder, and ride home
again; sometimes, when it was a very
warm day and he had dined more heartily
than usual, he would fall asleep during
the ride, still holding on to his place with
his long, sharp claws. Sometimes I would
come home with my pinafore torn and
bloody on the shoulder, and then my mother
would scold me a little and laugh at
me a great deal. I would blush and hang
my head and cry, but still cling to my
strange pet; and when he got full-grown
and had wide, strong wings, and a great,
crooked beak that every body else was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
afraid of, I was still his warm friend and
his humble servant, still carried him to
his meals three times a day, shut him into
his house every night, and let him out
every morning. Such a life as that bird
led me!</p>

<p>Toby was perfectly tame, and never attempted
to fly beyond the yard. I thought
this was because he loved me too well to
leave me; but my brothers, to whom he
was rather cross, said it was because he
was a stupid fowl. Of course they only
wanted to tease me. I said that Toby
was rough, but honest; that it was true
he did not make a display of his talents
like some folks, but that I had faith to
believe that, some time before he died, he
would prove himself to them all to be a
bird of good feelings and great intelligence.</p>

<p>Finally the time came for Toby to be
respected as he deserved. One autumn
night I had him with me in the sitting-room,
where I played with him and let<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
him perch on my arm till it was quite late.
Some of the neighbours were in, and the
whole circle told ghost-stories, and talked
about dreams, and warnings, and awful
murders, till I was half frightened out of
my wits; so that, when I went to put my
sleepy hawk into his little house, I really
dared not go into the dark, but stopped in
the entry, and left him to roost for one
night on the hat-rack, saying nothing to
any one. Now it happened that my brother
William, who was then about fourteen
years of age, was a somnambulist,—that
is, a person who walks in sleep. He
would often rise in the middle of the
night, and ramble off for miles, always returning
unwaked. Sometimes he would
take the horse from the stable, saddle and
bridle him, and have a wild gallop in the
moonlight. Sometimes he would drive
the cows home from pasture, or let the
sheep out of the pen. Sometimes he
would wrap himself in a sheet, glide about
the house, and appear at our bedside like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
a ghost. But in the morning he had no
recollection of these things. Of course,
we were very anxious about him, and tried
to keep a constant watch over him, but he
would sometimes manage to escape from
all our care. Well, that night there was
suddenly a violent outcry set up in the entry.
It was Toby, who shrieked and flapped
his wings till he woke my father, who
dressed and went down stairs to see what
was the matter. He found the door wide
open, and the hawk sitting uneasily on his
perch, looking frightened and indignant,
with all his feathers raised. My father, at
once suspecting what had happened, ran
up to William’s chamber and found his
bed empty; he then roused my elder
brothers, and, having lit a lantern, they
all started off in pursuit of the poor boy.
They searched through the yard, garden,
and orchard, but all in vain. Suddenly
they heard the saw-mill, which stood near,
going. They knew that the owner never
worked there at night, and supposed that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
it must be my brother, who had set the
machinery in motion. So down they ran
as fast as possible, and, sure enough, they
found him there, all by himself. A large
log had the night before been laid in its
place ready for the morning, and on that
log sat my brother, his large black eyes
staring wide open, yet seeming to be fixed
on nothing, and his face as pale as death.
He seemed to have quite lost himself, for
the end of the log on which he sat was
fast approaching the saw. My father, with
great presence of mind, stopped the machinery,
while one of my brothers caught
William and pulled him from his perilous
place. Another moment, and he would
have been killed or horribly mangled by
the cruel saw. With a terrible scream,
that was heard to a great distance, poor
William awoke. He cried bitterly when
he found where he was and how he came
there. He was much distressed by it for
some time; but it was a very good thing
for all that, <i>for he never walked in his sleep
again</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>As you would suppose, Toby, received
much honor for so promptly giving the
warning on that night. Every body now
acknowledged that he was a hawk of great
talents, as well as talons. But alas! he
did not live long to enjoy the respect of
his fellow-citizens. One afternoon that
very autumn, I was sitting at play with
my doll, under the thick shade of a maple-tree,
in front of the house. On the
fence near by sat Toby, lazily pluming his
wing, and enjoying the pleasant, golden
sunshine,—now and then glancing round
at me with a most knowing and patronizing
look. Suddenly, there was the sharp
crack of a gun fired near, and Toby fell
fluttering to the ground. A stupid sportsman
had taken him for a wild hawk, and
shot him in the midst of his peaceful and
innocent enjoyment. He was wounded in
a number of places, and was dying fast
when I reached him. Yet he seemed to
know me, and looked up into my face so
piteously, that I sat down by him, as I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
had sat down by poor Keturah, and cried
aloud. Soon the sportsman, who was a
stranger, came leaping over the fence to
bag his game. When he found what he
had done, he said he was very sorry, and
stooped down to examine the wounds
made by his shot. Then Toby roused
himself, and caught one of his fingers in
his beak, biting it almost to the bone.
The man cried out with the pain, and tried
to shake him off, but Toby still held on
fiercely and stoutly, and held on till he
was dead. Then his ruffled wing grew
smooth, his head fell back, his beak parted
and let go the bleeding finger of his
enemy.</p>

<p>I did not want the man hurt, for he
had shot my pet under a mistake, but I
was not sorry to see Toby die like a hero.
We laid him with the pets who had gone
before. Some were lovelier in their lives,
but none more lamented when dead. I
will venture to say that he was the first
of his race who ever departed with a clean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
conscience as regarded poultry. No careful
mother-hen cackled with delight on
the day he died,—no pert young rooster
flapped his wings and crowed over his
grave. But I must say, I don’t think that
the frogs mourned for him. I thought that
they were holding a jubilee that night;
the old ones croaked so loud, and the
young ones sung so merrily, that I wished
the noisy green creatures all quietly going
brown, on some Frenchman’s gridiron.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">MILLY, THE PONY, AND CARLO,
THE DOG.</h2>
</div>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_p017.jpg" alt="decorative line"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I was ten or eleven years of age,
I had two pets, of which I was equally
fond, a gentle bay pony and a small
pointer dog. I have always had a great
affection for horses, and never knew what
it was to be afraid of them, for they are
to me exceedingly obliging and obedient.
Some people think that I control them
with a sort of animal magnetism. I only
know that I treat them with <i>kindness</i>,
which is, I believe, after all, the only magnetism
necessary for one to use in this
world. When I ride, I give my horse to
understand that I expect him to behave
very handsomely, like the gentleman I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
take him to be, and he never disappoints
me.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe31_25" id="i_p034p">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption"><span class="smcap">MILLY the pony</span> &amp; <span class="smcap">CARLO the dog.</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Our Milly was a great favorite with all
the family, but with the children especially.
She was not very handsome or remarkably
fleet, but was easily managed,
and even in her gait. I loved her dearly,
and we were on the best terms with each
other. I was in the habit of going into
the pasture where she fed, mounting her
from the fence or a stump, and riding
about the field, often without saddle or bridle.
You will see by this that I was a sad
romp. Milly seemed to enjoy the sport
fully as much as I, and would arch her
neck, and toss her mane, and gallop up and
down the little hills in the pasture, now
and then glancing round at me playfully,
as much as to say, “Aint we having
times!”</p>

<p>Finally, I began to practise riding standing
upright, as I had seen the circus performers
do, for I thought it was time I
should do something to distinguish myself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
After a few tumbles on to the soft
clover, which did me no sort of harm, I
became quite accomplished that way. I
was at that age as quick and active as a
cat, and could save myself from a fall after
I had lost my balance, and seemed half way
to the ground. I remember that my
brother William was very ambitious to
rival me in my exploits; but as he was
unfortunately rather fat and heavy, he did
a greater business in turning somersets
from the back of the pony than in any
other way. But these were quite as amusing
as any other part of the performances.
We sometimes had quite a good audience
of the neighbours’ children, and our
schoolmates, but we never invited our
parents to attend the exhibition. We
thought that on some accounts it was best
they should know nothing about it.</p>

<p>In addition to the “ring performances,”
I gave riding lessons to my youngest brother,
Albert, who was then quite a little
boy. He used to mount Milly behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
me, and behind him always sat one of our
chief pets, and our constant playmate,
Carlo, a small black and white pointer.
One afternoon, I remember, we were all
riding down the long, shady lane which
led from the pasture to the house, when a
mischievous boy sprang suddenly out from
a corner of the fence, and shouted at Milly.
I never knew her frightened before,
but this time she gave a loud snort, and
reared up almost straight in the air. As
there was neither saddle nor bridle for us
to hold on by, we all three slid off backward
into the dust, or rather the mud, for
it had been raining that afternoon. Poor
Carlo was most hurt, as my brother and I
fell on him. He set up a terrible yelping,
and my little brother cried somewhat from
fright. Milly turned and looked at us a
moment to see how much harm was done,
and then started off at full speed after the
boy, chasing him down the lane. He ran
like a fox when he heard Milly galloping
fast behind him, and when he looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
round and saw her close upon him, with
her ears laid back, her mouth open, and
her long mane flying in the wind, he
screamed with terror, and dropped as
though he were dead. She did not stop,
but leaped clear over him as he lay on
the ground. Then she turned, went up
to him, quietly lifted the old straw hat
from his head, and came trotting back to
us, swinging it in her teeth. We thought
that was a very cunning trick of Milly’s.</p>

<p>Now it happened that I had on that
day a nice new dress, which I had sadly
soiled by my fall from the pony; so that
when I reached home, my mother was
greatly displeased. I suppose I made a
very odd appearance. I was swinging my
bonnet in my hand, for I had a natural
dislike to any sort of covering for the
head. My thick, dark hair had become
unbraided and was blowing over my eyes.
I was never very fair in complexion, and
my face, neck, and arms had become completely
browned by that summer’s exposure.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
My mother took me by the shoulder,
set me down in a chair, not very
gently, and looked at me with a real frown
on her sweet face. She told me in plain
terms that I was an idle, careless child!
I put my finger in one corner of my
mouth, and swung my foot back and forth.
She said I was a great romp! I pouted
my lip, and drew down my black eyebrows.
She said I was more like a wild,
young squaw, than a white girl! Now
this was too much; it was what I called
“twitting upon facts”; and ’twas not the
first time that the delicate question of my
complexion had been touched upon without
due regard far my feelings. I was not
to blame for being dark,—I did not make
myself,—I <i>had</i> seen fairer women than my
mother. I felt that what she said was
neither more nor less than an insult, and
when she went out to see about supper,
and left me alone, I brooded over her
words, growing more and more out of humor,
till my naughty heart became so hot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
and big with anger, that it almost choked
me. At last, I bit my lip and looked very
stern, for I had made up my mind to something
great. Before I let you know what
this was, I must tell you that the Onondaga
tribe of Indians had their village not
many miles from us. Every few months,
parties of them came about with baskets
and mats to sell. A company of five or
six had been to our house that very morning,
and I knew that they had their encampment
in our woods, about half a mile
distant. These I knew very well, and
had quite a liking for them, never thinking
of being afraid of them, as they always
seemed kind and peaceable.</p>

<p>To them I resolved to go in my trouble.
They would teach me to weave baskets,
to fish, and to shoot with the bow and arrow.
They would not make me study, nor
wear bonnets, and they would never find
fault with my dark complexion.</p>

<p>I remember to this day how softly and
slyly I slid out of the house that evening.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
I never stopped once, nor looked round,
but ran swiftly till I reached the woods.
I did not know which way to go to find
the encampment, but wandered about in
the gathering darkness, till I saw a light
glimmering through the trees at some distance.
I made my way through the bushes
and brambles, and after a while came upon
my copper-colored friends. In a very
pretty place, down in a hollow, they had
built them some wigwams with maple
saplings, covered with hemlock-boughs.
There were in the group two Indians, two
squaws, and a boy about fourteen years
old. But I must not forget the baby, or
rather pappoose, who was lying in a sort
of cradle, made of a large, hollow piece
of bark, which was hung from the branch
of a tree, by pieces of the wild grape-vine.
The young squaw, its mother, was swinging
it back and forth, now far into the
dark shadows of the pine and hemlock,
now out into the warm fire-light, and
chanting to the child some Indian lullaby.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
The men sat on a log, smoking gravely
and silently; while the boy lay on the
ground, playing lazily with a great yellow
hound, which looked mean and starved,
like all Indian dogs. The old squaw was
cooking the supper in a large iron pot, over
a fire built among a pile of stones.</p>

<p>For some time, I did not dare to go forward,
but at last I went up to the old
squaw, and looking up into her good-humored
face, said, “I am come to live
with you, and learn to make baskets, for I
don’t like my home.” She did not say
any thing to me, but made some exclamation
in her own language, and the others
came crowding round. The boy laughed,
shook me by the hand, and said I was a
brave girl; but the old Indian grinned
horribly and laid his hand on my forehead,
saying, “What a pretty head to scalp!”
I screamed and hid my face in the young
squaw’s blue cloth skirt. She spoke soothingly,
and told me not to be afraid, for
nobody would hurt me. She then took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
me to her wigwam, where I sat down and
tried to make myself at home. But somehow
I did’nt feel quite comfortable. After
a while, the old squaw took off the pot,
and called us to supper. This was succotash,
that is, a dish of corn and beans,
cooked with salt pork. We all sat down
on the ground near the fire, and eat out of
great wooden bowls, with wooden spoons,
which I must say tasted rather too strong
of the pine. But I did not say so then,—by
no means,—but eat a great deal more
than I wanted, and pretended to relish it,
for fear they would think me ill bred. I
would not have had them know but what
I thought their supper served in the very
best style, and by perfectly polite and genteel
people. I was a little shocked, however,
by one incident during the meal.
While the young squaw was helping her
husband for the third or fourth time, she
accidentally dropped a little of the hot
succotash on his hand. He growled out
like a dog, and struck her across the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
face with his spoon. I thought that she
showed a most Christian spirit, for she
hung her head and did not say any thing.
I had heard of white wives behaving
worse.</p>

<p>When supper was over, the boy came
and laid down at my feet, and talked with
me about living in the woods. He said
he pitied the poor white people for being
shut up in houses all their days. For his
part, he should die of such a dull life, he
knew he should. He promised to teach
me how to shoot with the bow and arrows,
to snare partridges and rabbits, and many
other things. He said he was afraid I
was almost spoiled by living in the house
and going to school, but he hoped that, if
they took me away and gave me a new
name, and dressed me properly, they
might make something of me yet. Then
I asked him what he was called, hoping
that he had some grand Indian name, like
Uncas, or Miantonimo, or Tushmalahah;
but he said it was Peter. He was a pleasant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
fellow, and while he was talking with
me I did not care about my home, but
felt very brave and squaw-like, and began
to think about the fine belt of wampum,
and the head-dress of gay feathers, and
the red leggins, and the yellow moccasons
I was going to buy for myself, with the
baskets I was going to learn to weave.
But when he left me, and I went back to
the wigwam and sat down on the hemlock-boughs
by myself, somehow I couldn’t
keep home out of my mind. I thought
first of my mother, how she would miss
the little brown face at the supper-table,
and on the pillow, by the fair face of my
blue-eyed sister. I thought of my young
brother, Albert, crying himself to sleep,
because I was lost. I thought of my father
and brothers searching through the
orchard and barn, and going with lights
to look in the mill-stream. Again, I
thought of my mother, how, when she
feared I was drowned, she would cry bitterly,
and be very sorry for what she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
said about my dark complexion. Then I
thought of myself, how I must sleep on
the hard ground, with nothing but hemlock-boughs
for covering, and nobody to
tuck me up. What if it should storm before
morning, and the high tree above me
should be struck by lightning! What if
the old Indian should not be a tame savage
after all, but should take a fancy to
set up the war-whoop, and come and scalp
me in the middle of the night!</p>

<p>The bell in the village church rang for
nine. This was the hour for evening devotions
at home. I looked round to see
if my new friends were preparing for worship.
But the old Indian was already fast
asleep, and as for the younger one, I feared
that a man who indulged himself in beating
his wife with a wooden spoon would
hardly be likely to lead in family prayers.
Upon the whole, I concluded I was among
rather a heathenish set. Then I thought
again of home, and doubted whether they
would have any family worship that night,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
with one lamb of the flock gone astray.
I thought of all their grief and fears, till I
felt that my heart would burst with sorrow
and repentance, for I dared not cry
aloud.</p>

<p>Suddenly, I heard a familiar sound at a
little distance,—it was Carlo’s bark!
Nearer and nearer it came; then I heard
steps coming fast through the crackling
brushwood, then little Carlo sprang out
of the dark into the fire-light, and leaped
upon me, licking my hands with joy. He
was followed by one of my elder brothers,
and by my <i>mother</i>! To her I ran. I
dared not look in her eyes, but hid my
face in her bosom, sobbing out, “O mother,
forgive me! forgive me!” She pressed
me to her heart, and bent down and
kissed me very tenderly, and when she
did so, I felt the tears on her dear cheek.</p>

<p>I need hardly say that I never again
undertook to make an Onondaga squaw
of myself, though my mother always held
that I was dark enough to be one, and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
suppose the world would still bear her out
in her opinion.</p>

<p>I am sorry to tell the fate of the faithful
dog who tracked me out on that night,
though his story is not quite so sad as that
of some of my pets. A short time after
this event, my brother Charles was going
to the city of S——, some twenty miles
away, and wished to take Carlo for company.
I let him go very reluctantly,
charging my brother to take good and
constant care of him. The last time I
ever saw Carlo’s honest, good-natured face,
it was looking out at me through the
window of the carriage. The <i>last time</i>,
for he never came back to us, but was lost
in the crowded streets of S——.</p>

<p>He was a simple, country-bred pointer,
and, like many another poor dog, was bewildered
by the new scenes and pleasures
of the city, forgot his guide, missed his
way, wandered off, and was never found.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CORA, THE SPANIEL.</h2>
</div>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_p017.jpg" alt="decorative line"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> pet which took little Carlo’s place
in our home and hearts was a pretty,
chestnut-colored water-spaniel, named Cora.
She was a good, affectionate creature,
and deserved all our love. The summer
that we had her for our playmate, my
brother Albert, my sister Carrie, and I,
spent a good deal of time down about the
pond, in watching her swimming, and all
her merry gambols in the water. There
grew, out beyond the reeds and flags of
that pond, a few beautiful, white water-lilies,
which we taught her to bite off and
bring to us on shore.</p>

<p>Cora seemed to love us very much, but
there was one whom she loved even more.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
This was little Charlie Allen, a pretty boy
of about four or five years old, the only
son of a widow, who was a tenant of my
father, and lived in a small house on our
place. There grew up a great and tender
friendship between this child and our Cora,
who was always with him while we were
at school. The two would play and run
about for hours, and when they were tired,
lie down and sleep together in the shade.
It was a pretty sight, I assure you, for
both were beautiful.</p>

<p>It happened that my father, one morning,
took Cora with him to the village,
and was gone nearly all day; so little
Charlie was without his playmate and protector.
But after school, my sister, brother,
and I called Cora, and ran down to
the pond. We were to have a little company
that night, and wanted some of those
fragrant, white lilies for our flower-vase.
Cora barked and leaped upon us, and ran
round and round us all the way. Soon
as she reached the pond, she sprang in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
and swam out to where the lilies grew,
and where she was hid from our sight by
the flags and other water-plants. Presently,
we heard her barking and whining,
as though in great distress. We called
to her again and again, but she did not
come out for some minutes. At last, she
came through the flags, swimming slowly
along, dragging something by her teeth.
As she swam near, we saw that it was a
child,—little Charlie Allen! We then
waded out as far as we dared, met Cora,
took her burden from her, and drew it
to the shore. As soon as we took little
Charlie in our arms, we knew that he was
dead. He was cold as ice, his eyes were
fixed in his head, and had no light in
them. His hand was stiff and blue, and
still held tightly three water-lilies, which
he had plucked. We suppose the poor
child slipped from a log, on which he had
gone out for the flowers, and which was
half under water.</p>

<p>Of course we children were dreadfully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
frightened. My brother was half beside
himself, and ran screaming up home, while
my sister almost flew for Mrs. Allen.</p>

<p>O, I never shall forget the grief of that
poor woman, when she came to the spot
where her little dead boy lay!—how she
threw herself on the ground beside him,
and folded him close in her arms, and tried
to warm him with her tears and her kisses,
and tried to breathe her own breath into
his still, cold lips, and tried to make him
hear by calling, “Charlie, Charlie, speak
to mamma! speak to your poor mamma!”</p>

<p>But Charlie did not see her, nor feel
her, nor hear her any more; and when
she found that he was indeed gone from
her for ever, she gave the most fearful
shriek I ever heard, and fell back as
though she were dead.</p>

<p>By this time, my parents and a number
of the neighbours had reached the spot,
and they carried Mrs. Allen and her
drowned boy home together, through the
twilight. Poor Cora followed close to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
the body of Charlie, whining piteously all
the way. That night, we could not get
her out of the room where it was placed,
but she watched there until morning.</p>

<p>Ah, how sweetly little Charlie looked
when he was laid out the next day! His
beautiful face had lost the dark look that
it wore when he was first taken from the
water; his pretty brown hair lay in close
ringlets all around his white forehead.
One hand was stretched at his side, the
other was laid across his breast, still holding
the water-lilies. He was not dressed
in a shroud, but in white trousers, and a
pretty little spencer of pink gingham.
He did not look dead, but sleeping, and
he seemed to smile softly, as though he
had a pleasant dream in his heart.</p>

<p>Widow Allen had one other child, a year
younger than Charlie, whose name was
Mary, but who always called herself “Little
May.” O, it would have made you cry
to have seen her when she was brought
to look on her dead brother. She laughed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
at first, and put her small fingers on his
shut eyes, trying to open them, and said,
“Wake up Charlie! wake up, and come
play out doors, with little May!” But
when she found that those eyes would
not unclose, and when she felt how cold
that face was, she was grieved and frightened,
and ran to hide her face in her
mother’s lap, where she cried and trembled;
for though she could not know what
death was, she felt that something awful
had happened in the house.</p>

<p>But Cora’s sorrow was also sad to see.
When the body of Charlie was carried to
the grave, she followed close to the coffin,
and when it was let down into the grave,
she leaped in and laid down upon it, and
growled and struggled when the men took
her out. Every day after that, she would
go to that grave, never missing the spot,
though there were many other little
mounds in the old church-yard. She
would lie beside it for hours, patiently
waiting, it seemed, for her young friend to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
awake and come out into the sunshine,
and run about and play with her as he
was used to do. Sometimes she would
dig a little way into the mound, and bark,
or whine, and then listen for the voice of
Charlie to answer. But that voice never
came, though the faithful Cora listened
and waited and pined for it, through
many days. She ate scarcely any thing;
she would not play with us now, nor could
we persuade her to go into the pond.
Alas! that fair, sweet child, pale and dripping
from the water, was the last lily she
ever brought ashore. She grew so thin,
and weak, and sick, at last, that she could
hardly drag herself to the grave. But
still she went there every day. One evening,
she did not come home, and my
brother and I went down for her. When
we reached the church-yard, we passed
along very carefully, for fear of treading
on some grave, and spoke soft and low,
as children should always do in such
places. Sometimes we stopped to read<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
the long inscriptions on handsome tombstones,
and to wonder why so many great
and good people were taken away. Sometimes
we pitied the poor dead people who
had no tombstones at all, because their
friends could not afford to raise them, or
because they had been too wicked themselves
to have their praises printed in
great letters, cut in white marble, and put
up in the solemn burying-ground, where
nobody would ever dare to write or say
any thing but the truth. When we came
in sight of Charlie’s grave, we talked
about him. We wondered if he thought
of his mother, and cried out any when he
was drowning. We thought that he must
have grown very weary with struggling in
the water, and we wondered if he was
resting now, sleeping down there with his
lilies. We said that perhaps his <i>soul</i> was
awake all the time, and that, when he was
drowned, it did not fly right away to
heaven, with the angels, to sing hymns,
while his poor mother was weeping, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
stayed about the place, and somehow comforted
her, and made her think of God
and heaven, even when she lay awake in
the night, to mourn for her lost boy.</p>

<p>So talking, we came up to the grave.
Cora was lying on the mound, where the
grass had now grown green and long.
She seemed to be asleep, and not to hear
our steps or our voices. My brother spoke
to her pleasantly, and patted her on the
head. But she did not move. I bent
down and looked into her face. She was
quite dead!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">JACK, THE DRAKE.</h2>
</div>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_p017.jpg" alt="decorative line"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> hesitated a great deal about
writing the history of this pet, for his little
life was only a chapter of accidents,
and you may think it very silly. Still, I
hope you may have a little interest in it
after all, and that your kind hearts may
feel for poor Jack, for he was good and
was unfortunate.</p>

<p>It happened that once, during a walk in
the fields, I found a duck’s egg right in
my path. We had then no ducks in our
farm-yard, and I thought it would be a
fine idea to have one for a pet. So I
wrapped the egg in wool, and put it into a
basket, which I hung in a warm corner
by the kitchen-fire. My brothers laughed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
at me, saying that the egg would never be
any thing more than an egg, if left there;
but I had faith to believe that I should
some time see a fine duckling peeping out
of the shell, very much to the astonishment
of all unbelieving boys. I used to
go to the basket, lift up the wool and look
at that little blue-hued treasure three or
four times a day, or take it out and hold
it against my bosom, and breathe upon it
in anxious expectation; until I began to
think that a watched egg never would
hatch. But my tiresome suspense finally
came to a happy end. At about the time
when, if he had had a mother, she would
have been looking for him, Jack, the
drake, presented his bill to the world that
owed him a living. He came out as
plump and hearty a little fowl as could
reasonably have been expected. But what
to do with him was the question. After
a while, I concluded to take him to a hen
who had just hatched a brood of chickens,
thinking that, as he was a friendless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
orphan, she might adopt him for charity’s
sake. But Biddy was already like the celebrated</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent1">“Old woman that lived in a shoe,</div>
<div class="verse">Who had so many children she didn’t know what to do.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>With thirteen little ones of her own, and
living in a small and rather an inconvenient
coop, it was no wonder that she felt
unwilling to have any addition to her family.
But she might have declined civilly.
I am afraid she was a sad vixen, for no
sooner did she see the poor duckling
among her chickens, than she strode up
to him, and with one peck tore the skin
from his head,—scalped him,—the old
savage! I rescued Jack from her as
soon as possible, and dressed his wound
with lint as well as I could, for I felt
something like a parent to the fowl myself.
He recovered after a while, but,
unfortunately, no feathers grew again on
his head,—he was always quite bald,—which
gave him an appearance of great
age. I once tried to remedy this evil by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
sticking some feathers on to his head with
tar; but, like all other wigs, it deceived
no one, only making him look older and
queerer than ever. What made the matter
worse was, that I had selected some
long and very bright feathers, which stood
up so bold on his head that the other
fowls resented it, and pecked at the poor
wig till they pecked it all off.</p>

<p>While Jack was yet young, he one day
fell into the cistern, which had been left
open. Of course he could not get out,
and he soon tired of swimming, I suppose,
and sunk. At least, when he was drawn
up, he looked as though he had been in
the water a long time, and seemed quite
dead. Yet, hoping to revive him, I placed
him in his old basket of wool, which I set
down on the hearth. He did indeed come
to life, but the first thing the silly creature
did on leaving his nest was to run into
the midst of the fire, and before I could
get him out, he was very badly burned.
He recovered from this also, but with bare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
spots all over his body. In his tail there
never afterwards grew more than three
short feathers. But his trials were not
over yet. After he was full-grown, he
was once found fast by one leg in a great
iron rat-trap. When he was released, his
leg was found to be broken. But my
brother William, who was then inclined to
be a doctor, which he has since become,
and who had watched my father during
surgical operations, splintered and bound
up the broken limb, and kept the patient
under a barrel for a week, so that he
should not attempt to use it. At the end
of that time, Jack could get about a little,
but with a very bad limp, which he never
got over. But as the duck family never
had the name of walking very handsomely,
that was no great matter.</p>

<p>After all these accidents and mishaps, I
hardly need tell you that Jack had little
beauty to boast of, or plume himself upon.
He was in truth sadly disfigured,—about
the ugliest fowl possible to meet in a long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
day’s journey. Indeed, he used to be
shown up to people as a curiosity on account
of his ugliness.</p>

<p>I remember a little city girl coming to
see me that summer. She talked a great
deal about her fine wax-dolls with rolling
eyes and jointed legs, her white, curly
French lap-dog, and, best and prettiest of
every thing, her beautiful yellow canary-bird,
which sung and sung all the day long.
I grew almost dizzy with hearing of such
grand and wonderful things, and sat with
my mouth wide open to swallow her great
stories. At last, she turned to me and
asked, with a curl of her pretty red lips,
“Have you no pet-birds, little girl?”
Now, she always called me “little girl,”
though I was a year older and a head
taller than she. I replied, “Yes, I have
one,” and led the way to the back-yard,
where I introduced her to Jack. I
thought I should have died of laughter
when she came to see him. Such faces as
she made up!</p>

<p>I am sorry to say, that the other fowls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
in the yard, from the oldest hen down to
the rooster without spurs, and even to the
green goslings, seemed to see and feel
Jack’s want of personal pretensions and
attractions, and always treated him with
marked contempt, not to say cruelty. The
little chickens followed him about, peeping
and cackling with derision, very much
as the naughty children of the old Bible
times mocked at the good, bald-headed
prophet. But poor Jack didn’t have it in
his power to punish the ill-mannered creatures
as Elisha did those saucy children,
when he called the hungry she-bears to
put a stop to their wicked fun. In fact, I
don’t think he would have done so if he
could, for all this hard treatment never
made him angry or disobliging. He had
an excellent temper, and was always meek
and quiet, though there was a melancholy
hang to his bald head, and his three lonesome
tail-feathers drooped sadly toward
the ground. When he was ever so lean
and hungry, he would gallantly give up
his dinner to the plump, glossy-breasted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
pullets, though they would put on lofty
airs, step lightly, eye him scornfully, and
seem to be making fun of his queer looks
all the time. He took every thing so kindly!
He was like a few, a very few people
we meet, who, the uglier they grow, the
more goodness they have at heart, and the
worse the world treats them, the better
they are to it.</p>

<p>But Jack had one true friend. I liked
him, and more than once defended him
from cross old hens, and tyrannical cocks.
But perhaps my love was too much mixed
up with pity for him to have felt highly
complimented by it. Yet he seemed to
cherish a great affection for me, and to look
up to me as his guardian and protector.</p>

<p>As you have seen, Jack was always getting
into scrapes, and at last he got into
one which even I could not get him out
of. He one day rashly swam out into the
mill-pond, which was then very high, from
a freshet, and which carried him over the
dam, where, as he was a very delicate fowl,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
he was drowned, or his neck was broken,
by the great rush and tumble of the water.
I have sometimes thought that it
might be that he was tired of life, and
grieved by the way the world had used
him, and so put an end to himself. But
I hope it was not so; for, with all his
oddities and misfortunes, Jack seemed
too sensible for that.</p>

</div>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_p017.jpg" alt="decorative line"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hector</span> was the favorite hound of my
brother Rufus, who was extremely fond
of him, for he was one of the most beautiful
creatures ever seen, had an amiable
disposition, and was very intelligent. You
would scarcely believe me, should I tell
you all his accomplishments and cunning
tricks. If one gave him a piece of money,
he would take it in his mouth and run at
once to the baker, or butcher, for his dinner.
He was evidently fond of music,
and even seemed to have an ear for it,
and he would dance away merrily whenever
he saw dancing. He was large and
strong, and in the winter, I remember, we
used to harness him to a little sleigh, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
which he drew my youngest brother to
school. As Hector was as fleet as the
wind, this sort of riding was rare sport.
At night we had but to start him off, and
he would go directly to the school-house
for his little master. Ah, Hector was a
wonderful dog!</p>

<p>A few miles from our house, there was
a pond, or small lake, very deep and dark,
and surrounded by a swampy wood. Here
my brothers used to go duck-shooting,
though it was rather dangerous sport, as
most of the shore of the pond was a soft
bog, but thinly grown over with grass and
weeds. It was said that cattle had been
known to sink in it, and disappear in a
short time.</p>

<p>One night during the hunting season,
one of my elder brothers brought a friend
home with him, a fine, handsome young
fellow, named Charles Ashley. It was arranged
that they should shoot ducks about
the pond the next day. So in the morning
they all set out in high spirits. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
the forenoon they had not much luck, as
they kept too much together; but in the
afternoon they separated, my brothers giving
their friend warning to beware of
getting into the bogs. But Ashley was a
wild, imprudent young man, and once,
having shot a fine large duck, which fell
into the pond near the shore, and Hector,
who was with him, refusing to go into the
water for it, he ran down himself. Before
he reached the edge of the water, he was
over his ankles in mire; then, turning
to go back, he sunk to his knees, and in
another moment he was waist-high in the
bog, and quite unable to help himself. He
laid his gun down, and, fortunately, could
rest one end of it on a little knoll of firmer
earth; but he still sunk slowly, till he was
in up to his arm-pits. Of course, he called
and shouted for help as loud as possible,
but my brothers were at such a distance
that they did not hear him so as to know
his voice. But Hector, after looking at
him in his sad fix a moment, started off on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
a swift run, which soon brought him to his
master. My brother said that the dog then
began to whine, and run back and forth in
a most extraordinary manner, until he set
out to follow him to the scene of the accident.
Hector dashed on through the
thick bushes, as though he were half distracted,
every few moments turning back
with wild cries to hurry on his master.
When my brother came up to where his
friend was fixed in the mire, he could see
nothing of him at first. Then he heard a
faint voice calling him, and, looking down
near the water, he saw a pale face looking
up at him from the midst of the black
bog. He has often said that it was the
strangest sight that he ever saw. Poor
Ashley’s arms, and the fowling-piece he
held, were now beginning to disappear,
and in a very short time he would have
sunk out of sight for ever! Only to think
of such an awful death! My brother,
who had always great presence of mind,
lost no time in bending down a young tree<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
from the bank where he stood, so that
Ashley could grasp it, and in that way be
drawn up, for, as you see, it would not
have been safe for him to go down to
where his friend sunk. When Ashley
had taken a firm hold of the sapling, my
brother let go of it, and it sprung back,
pulling up the young man without much
exertion on his part. Ashley was, however,
greatly exhausted with fright and
struggling, and lay for some moments on
the bank, feeling quite unable to walk.
As soon as he was strong enough, he set
out for home with my brother, stopping
very often to rest and shake off the thick
mud, which actually weighed heavily upon
him. I never shall forget how he looked
when he came into the yard about sunset.
O, what a rueful and ridiculous figure he
cut! We could none of us keep from
laughing, though we were frightened at
first, and sorry for our guest’s misfortune.
But after he was dressed in a dry suit of
my brother’s, he looked funnier than ever,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
for he was a tall, rather large person, and
the dress was too small for him every way.
Yet he laughed as heartily as any of us,
for he was very good-natured and merry.
It seems to me I can see him now, as he
walked about with pantaloons half way
up to his knees, coat-sleeves coming a little
below the elbows, and vest that wouldn’t
meet at all, and told us queer Yankee
stories, and sung songs, and jested and
laughed all the evening. But once, I remember,
I saw him go out on to the door-step,
where Hector was lying, kneel down
beside the faithful dog, and actually hug
him to his breast.</p>

<p>When not hunting with his master
Hector went with Albert and me in all
our rambles, berrying and nutting. We
could hardly be seen without him, and we
loved him almost as we loved one another.</p>

<p>One afternoon in early spring, we had
been into the woods for wild-flowers. I
remember that I had my apron filled with
the sweet claytonias, and the gay trilliums,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
and the pretty white flowers of the sanguinaria,
or “blood-root,” and hosts and
handfuls of the wild violets, yellow and
blue. My brother had taken off his cap
and filled it with beautiful green mosses,
all lit up with the bright red squaw-berry.
We had just entered the long,
shady lane which ran down to the house,
and were talking and laughing very merrily,
when we saw a crowd of men and
boys running toward us and shouting as
they ran. Before them was a large, brown
bull-dog, that, as he came near, we saw
was foaming at the mouth. Then we
heard what the men were crying. It was,
“<i>Mad dog!</i>”</p>

<p>My brother and I stopped and clung to
each other in great trouble. Hector stood
before us and growled. The dog was already
so near that we saw we could not escape;
he came right at us, with his dreadful
frothy mouth wide open. He was just
upon us, when Hector caught him by the
throat, and the two rolled on the ground,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
biting and struggling. But presently one
of the men came up and struck the mad
dog on the head with a large club,—so
stunned him and finally killed him. But
Hector, poor Hector, was badly bitten in
the neck and breast, and all the men said
that he must die too, or he would go mad.
One of the neighbours went home with
us, and told my father and elder brothers
all about it. They were greatly troubled,
but promised that, for the safety of the
neighbourhood, Hector should be shot in
the morning. I remember how, while they
were talking, Hector lay on the door-step
licking his wounds, every now and then
looking round, as if he thought that there
was some trouble which he ought to understand.</p>

<p>I shall never, never forget how I grieved
that night! I heard the clock strike ten,
eleven, and twelve, as I lay awake weeping
for my dear playfellow and noble preserver,
who was to die in the morning.
Hector was sleeping in the next room, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
once I got up and stole out to see him as
he lay on the hearth-rug in the clear moonlight,
resting unquietly, for his wounds
pained him. I went and stood so near that
my tears fell on his beautiful head; but I
was careful not to wake him, for I somehow
felt guilty toward him.</p>

<p>That night the weather changed, and
the next morning came up chilly and
windy, with no sunshine at all,—as
though it would not have been a gloomy
day enough, any how. After breakfast—ah!
I remember well how little breakfast
was eaten by any of us that morning—Hector
was led out into the yard, and fastened
to a stake. He had never before in
all his life been tied, and he now looked
troubled and ashamed. But my mother
spoke pleasantly to him and patted him,
and he held up his head and looked proud
again. My mother was greatly grieved
that the poor fellow should have to die
for defending her children, and when she
turned from him and went into the house,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
I saw she was in tears; so I cried louder
than ever. One after another, we all went
up and took leave of our dear and faithful
friend. My youngest brother clung about
him longest, crying and sobbing as though
his heart would break. It seemed that
we should never get the child away. My
brother Rufus said that no one should
shoot his dog but himself, and while we
children were bidding farewell, he stood
at a little distance loading his rifle. But
finally he also came up to take leave. He
laid his hand tenderly on Hector’s head,
but did not speak to him or look into
his eyes,—those sad eyes, which seemed
to be asking what all this crying meant.
He then stepped quickly back to his place,
and raised the rifle to his shoulder. Then
poor Hector appeared to understand it all,
and to know that he must die, for he gave
a loud, mournful cry, trembled all over,
and crouched toward the ground. My
brother dropped the gun, and leaned upon
it, pale and distressed. Then came the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
strangest thing of all. Hector seemed to
have strength given him to submit to his
hard fate; he stood up bravely again, but
turned away his head and closed his eyes.
My brother raised the rifle. I covered my
face with my hands. Then came a loud,
sharp report. I looked round and saw
Hector stretched at full length, with a
great stream of blood spouting from his
white breast, and reddening all the grass
about him. He was not quite dead, and
as we gathered around him, he looked up
into our faces and moaned. The ball
which pierced him had cut the cord in two
that bound him to the stake, and he was
free at the last. My brother, who had
thrown down his rifle, drew near also, but
dared not come close, because, he said, he
feared the poor dog would look reproachfully
at him. But Hector caught sight
of his beloved master, and, rousing all
his strength, dragged himself to his feet.
Rufus bent over him and called him by
name. Hector looked up lovingly and forgivingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
into his face, licked his hand, and
died. Then my brother, who had kept a
firm, manly face all the while, burst into
tears.</p>

<p>My brother William, who was always
master of ceremonies on such occasions,
made a neat coffin for Hector, and laid him
in it, very gently and solemnly. I flung
in all the wild-flowers which Albert and I
had gathered on the afternoon of our last
walk with our noble friend, and so we
buried him. His grave was very near the
spot where he had so bravely defended us
from the mad dog, by the side of the way,
in the long, pleasant lane where the elm-trees
grew.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">BOB, THE COSSET.</h2>
</div>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_p017.jpg" alt="decorative line"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> cold night in March, my father
came in from the barn-yard, bringing a
little lamb, which lay stiff and still in
his arms, and appeared to be quite dead.
But my mother, who was good and kind
to all creatures, wrapped it in flannel, and,
forcing open its teeth, poured some warm
milk down its throat. Still it did not open
its eyes or move, and when we went to
bed it was yet lying motionless before the
fire. It happened that my mother slept
in a room opening out of the sitting-room,
and in the middle of the night she heard
a little complaining voice, saying, “Ma!”
She thought it must be some one of us,
and so answered, “What, my child?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
Again it came, “Ma!” and, turning round,
she saw by the light of the moon the little
lamb she had left for dead standing by
her bedside. In the morning it was found
that the own mother of “Bob,” (for we
gave him that name,) had died of cold in
the night; so we adopted the poor orphan
into our family. We children took care of
him, and though it was a great trouble to
bring him up by hand, we soon became
attached to our charge, and grew very
proud of his handsome growth and thriving
condition. He was, in truth, a most
amusing pet, he had such free manners
with every body and was so entirely at
home everywhere. He would go into every
room in the house,—even mount the
stairs and appear in our chambers in the
morning, sometimes before we were up, to
shame us with his early rising. But the
place which of all others he decidedly preferred
was the pantry. Here he was, I am
sorry to say, once or twice guilty of breaking
the commandment against stealing, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
helping himself to fruit and to slices of
bread which did not rightfully belong to
him. He was tolerably amiable, though
I think that lambs generally have a greater
name for sweetness of temper than they
deserve. But Bob, though playful and
somewhat mischievous, had never any serious
disagreement with the dogs, cats,
pigs, and poultry on the premises. My
sister and I used to make wreaths for his
neck, which he wore with such an evident
attempt at display, that I sometimes feared
he was more vain and proud than it was
right for such an innocent and poetical
animal to be.</p>

<p>But our trials did not really commence
until Bob’s horns began to sprout. It
seemed that he had no sooner perceived
those little protuberances in his looking
glass, the drinking-trough, than he took
to butting, like any common pasture-reared
sheep, who had been wholly without
the advantages of education and good
society. It was in vain that we tried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
to impress upon him that such was not
correct conduct in a cosset of his breeding;
he would still persevere in his little
interesting trick of butting all such visitors
as did not happen to strike his fancy.
But he never treated us to his horns in
that way, and so we let him go, like any
other spoiled child, without punishing
him severely, and rather laughed at his
sauciness.</p>

<p>But one day our minister, a stout, elderly
gentleman, solemn-faced and formal,
had been making us a parochial visit, and
as he was going away, we all went out
into the yard to see him ride off, on his
old sorrel pacer. It seems he had no
riding-whip; so he reached up to break off
a twig from an elm-tree which hung over
the gate. This was very high, and he was
obliged to stand on tiptoe. Just then,
before he had grasped the twig he wanted,
Bob started out from under a large rose-bush
near by, and run against the reverend
gentleman, butting him so violently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
as to take him quite off his feet. My father
helped the good man up, and made
a great many apologies for the impiety of
our pet, while we children did our best to
keep our faces straight. After our venerable
visitor was gone, my father sternly
declared that he would not bear with Bob
any longer, but that he should be turned
into the pasture with the other sheep, for
he would not have him about, insulting
respectable people and butting ministers
of the Gospel at that rate.</p>

<p>So the next morning Bob was banished
in disgrace from the house and yard, and
obliged to mingle with the vulgar herd of
his kind. With them I regret to say that
he soon earned the name of being very
bold and quarrelsome. As his horns grew
and lengthened, he grew more and more
proud of the consequence they gave him,
and went forth butting and to butt. O,
he was a terrible fellow!</p>

<p>One summer day, my brother Charles
and a young man who lived with us were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
in the mill-pond, washing the sheep which
were soon to be sheared. I was standing
on the bank, watching the work, when
one of our neighbours, a hard, coarse man,
came up, and calling to my brother, in a
loud voice, asked if he had been hunting
a raccoon the night before. “Yes, Sir, and
I killed him too,” answered my brother.
“Well, young man,” said the farmer, “did
you pass through my field, and trample
down the grain?” “I crossed the field,
Sir, but I hope I did no great damage,” replied
Charles, in a pleasant way. “Yes,
you <i>did</i>!” shouted the man, “and now,
you young rascal, if I ever catch you on
my land again, day or night, I’ll thrash
you!—<i>I’ll</i> teach you something, if your
father won’t!” As he said this, stretching
his great fist out threateningly toward
my brother, he stood on the very edge of
the steep bank. Just behind him were
the sheep, headed by the redoubtable Bob,
who suddenly darted forward, and, before
the farmer could suspect what was coming,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
butted him head over heels into the pond!
My brother went at once to the assistance
of his enemy, who scrambled on to the
shore, sputtering and dripping, but a good
deal cooled in his rage. I suppose I was
very wicked, but I <i>did</i> enjoy that!</p>

<p>For this one good turn, Bob was always
quite a favorite, with all his faults, and
year after year was spared, when worthier
sheep were made mutton of. He was
finally sold, with the rest of the flock,
when we left the farm, and though he
lived to a good old age, the wool of his
last fleece must long since have been knit
into socks and comforters, or woven into
cloth,—must have grown threadbare,
and gone to dress scarecrows, or stop cellar-windows;
or been all trodden out in
rag-carpets.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I must</span> now, dear children, pass over a

</figure>

<p>At the time of my possessing my wonderful
Robin, we had left our country
home, my brothers were most of them
abroad in the world, and I was living with
my parents in the pleasant city of R——.
I was a school-girl, between fifteen and
sixteen years of age. That spring, I commenced
the study of French, and, as I was
never a remarkably bright scholar, I was
obliged to apply myself with great diligence
to my books. I used to take my
grammar and phrase-book to my chamber,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
at night, and study as long as I could possibly
keep my eyes open. In consequence
of this, as you may suppose, I was very
sleepy in the morning, and it usually took
a prodigious noise and something of a
shaking to waken me. But one summer
morning I was roused early, not by the
breakfast-bell, nor by calling, or shaking,
but by a glad gush of sweetest singing.
I opened my eyes, and right on the foot-board
of my bed was perched a pretty
red-breasted robin, pouring out all his little
soul in a merry morning song. I stole
out of bed softly, and shut down the window
through which he had come; then, as
soon as I was dressed, caught him, carried
him down stairs, and put him into a cage
which had hung empty ever since the cat
made way with my last Canary.</p>

<p>I soon found that I had a rare treasure
in my Robin, who was very tame, and had
evidently been carefully trained, for before
the afternoon was over he surprised and
delighted us all by singing the air of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
“Buy a Broom” quite through, touching
on every note with wonderful precision.
We saw that it was a valuable bird, who
had probably escaped, and for some days
we made inquiries for its owner, but without
success.</p>

<p>At night I always took Robin’s cage
into my chamber, and he was sure to
waken me early with his loud, but delicious,
singing. So passed on a month, in
which I had great happiness in my interesting
pet. But one Saturday forenoon I
let him out, that I might clean his cage.
I had not observed that there was a window
open, but the bird soon made himself
acquainted with the fact, and, with a glad,
exulting trill, he darted out into the sunshine.
Hastily catching my bonnet, I ran
after him. At first, he stayed about the
trees in front of the house, provokingly
hopping from branch to branch out of my
reach, holding his head on one side, and
eyeing me with sly, mischievous glances.
At last he spread his wings and flew down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
the street. I followed as fast as I could,
keeping my eye upon him all the time. It
was curious that he did not fly across
squares, or over the houses, but kept along
above the streets, slowly, and with a backward
glance once in a while. At length,
he turned down a narrow court, and flew
into the open window of a small frame-house.
Here I followed him, knocking
timidly at the door, which was opened at
once by a boy about nine years old. I
found myself in a small parlour, very
plainly, but neatly furnished. In an arm-chair
by the window sat a middle-aged
woman, who I saw at once was blind. A
tall, dark-eyed, rather handsome girl was
sitting near her, sewing. But I did not
look at either of these more than a moment,
for on the other side of the room was an
object to charm, and yet sadden, my eyes.
This was a slight girl, about my own age,
reclining on a couch, looking very ill and
pale, but with a small, red spot on each
cheek, which told me that she was almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
gone with consumption. She was very
beautiful, though so thin and weary looking.
She had large, dark, tender eyes, and
her lips were still as sweet as rose-buds.
I think I never saw such magnificent hair
as hers; it flowed all over her pillow, and
hung down nearly to the floor, in bright,
glossy ringlets.</p>

<p>At that moment she was holding the
truant Robin in her white, slender hands,
crying and laughing over him, calling
him her “dear lost pet,” her “naughty
runaway,” and a hundred other loving and
scolding names. I, of course, felt rather
awkward, but I explained matters to Robin’s
fair mistress as well as I could. She
looked pleased, and thanked me warmly
for the good care I had taken of the bird.
Then she made me sit down by her side,
and asked my name, and told me hers,
which was Ellen Harper, and introduced
me to her mother, sister, and brother, all
in the sweetest manner possible. We got
quite well acquainted, and talked like old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
friends, till Ellen’s cough interrupted her.
Then, as I rose to go, she made me promise
to come again very soon, and raised
herself as though she would kiss me before
I went. Just as I bent down to press
my lips to hers, Robin, who, of his own
accord, had taken possession of his old
cage, which had been left open for him,
burst out into a sweet, merry warble, full
of the most astonishing trills and shakes.
Then I felt that it was well that we two
should love one another.</p>

<p>After that, I went almost daily to see
Ellen Harper. I carried her books, I read
to her, talked to her, and listened to her
low gentle voice, and looked down deep
into her clear hazel eyes, till I grew to
love the sweet, patient girl more than I can
tell. I think that she was a most remarkable
person. Her parents were quite poor,
and she had enjoyed few advantages; but
she was far beyond me in scholarship and
reading. And then she was a true Christian,
with a calm hope, and a cheerful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
resignation; she seemed indeed to have
given her heart to God.</p>

<p>Ellen knew that she was dying; she
knew that, young and fair and beloved as
she was, she had not long to stay in this
bright, beautiful world. But she did not
fear, or complain, for she knew also that
a kind Father called her away, to a world
far brighter and many times more beautiful
than ours. It was touching to see her
trying to comfort her sister Lucy, whose
strength would sometimes give way as
she saw that slight form growing weaker
every day; or her young brother Willie,
when he would leave his book, or his play,
and come and lay his face against her bosom
and cry; or her father, when he would
come home from his work at night, and
sit down beside his darling child, and hold
her thin, fair fingers in his great, brown
hand, and say no word, only sigh as
though his poor heart was breaking; or
her mother, who was blind, and could not
see the change in her “own little Nellie,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
as she called her, and so had to be told
again and again that she was failing fast.
For all these dear ones, Ellen had words
of consolation, and they always felt stronger
after she had talked with them.</p>

<p>On some of those mornings when I
went over to dress her beautiful hair,
which I dearly loved to do, she talked to
me as an angel might talk, I thought, and
told me many sweet and holy things,
which I shall remember all the days of
my life.</p>

<p>As long as she stayed with us, Ellen had
great pleasure in her pet Robin. She said
that to her ear he always seemed to be
singing hymns, which was a great joy to
her after she became too weak to sing
them herself.</p>

<p>Dear Ellen died at night. She had
been very restless in the evening, and at
last said that, if she could lie in her mother’s
arms, as she used to lie when she was
a little child, she thought that she could
sleep. So Mrs. Harper laid down beside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
her daughter, who nestled against her bosom
and slept. Ellen’s happy spirit passed
away in that sleep. But her mother was
blind, and could not see when her child
was dead; and when her husband, fearing
what had happened, came near, she raised
her finger and said, “Hush, don’t wake
Nellie!”</p>

<p>The next morning, Lucy sent over for
me to come and dress Ellen’s hair for the
last time. I found my friend looking very
much as I had always seen her, only with
a sweeter smile, if possible, hovering about
her lips. She was lying on her couch,
dressed in white muslin, and with many
flowers scattered around her. A vase of
roses stood on a stand at her feet, and over
it hung the pretty cage of Robin, and
Robin himself was singing very sweetly,
but in lower tones than usual, as if he
thought his young mistress was sleeping,
and feared to waken her.</p>

<p>They had cut away some of the hair
from the back of Ellen’s head, but around<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
the forehead the familiar ringlets were
all left. These I dressed very carefully,
though my tears fell so fast, I could
scarcely see what I was doing. I shall
never forget the scene when the family
came into the parlour to look upon Ellen,
after she had been laid out, that morning.
Lucy, sobbing and trembling, led
her mother to the couch. The poor
woman felt in the air above the dead
face a moment, and said, “How I miss
her sweet breath round me!” Then
she knelt down, and, with her arms flung
over the body, swayed back and forth, and
seemed to pray silently. The father took
those shining curls in his hands, and
smoothed them tenderly and kissed them
many times, while his great hot tears fell
fast on the head of his child, and on the
rose-buds which lay upon her pillow, and
seemed to give a flush to her white, cold
cheek.</p>

<p>I noticed that little Willie was the calmest
of them all. He seemed to have taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
to heart the words of his sister, when she
told him that she was going into a better
and happier life, where she would continue
to love him, and whither he would come,
if he was good and true in this life. So
he did not grieve for her, as most children
grieve, but was quiet and submissive.</p>

<p>Ellen was buried in a beautiful cemetery
a mile or two from the noise and dust of
the city. The morning after she had been
laid there, I went to plant a little rose-tree
over her grave. I was somewhat surprised
to find Willie there, and with him
Robin Redbreast, in his pretty cage.</p>

<p>“Why have you brought the bird here,
Willie?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Because,” said he, in a low, trembling
voice, “I thought that, now sister’s spirit
was free, I ought not to keep her bird a
prisoner any longer.”</p>

<p>“That is right,” I said, for I thought
that this was a beautiful idea of the
child’s.</p>

<p>So Willie opened the door of the cage,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
and out flew the Robin. This time he did
not alight on the trees, but mounted right
up toward heaven. There was a light
cloud floating over us, and, as we stood
looking up after the bird, Willie seemed
troubled to see that it passed into this,
and so was lost to our sight. “Ah,” he
said, “I hoped he would follow Nellie!
but he has gone into the cloud, and sister’s
soul, I am very sure, passed away
into the sunshine.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">TOM.</h2>
</div>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_p017.jpg" alt="decorative line"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">I now</span> come to the very prince of pets,
the one of all I ever had the most noble
and most dear,—Tom, a Newfoundland
setter, the favorite dog of my brother Albert.
He has been a member of our family
for five or six years past. We brought
him from the city to our pleasant village
home in Pennsylvania, where we now live.</p>

<p>Tom is a dog of extraordinary beauty,
sagacity, and good feeling. He is very
large, and, with the exception of his feet
and breast, jet black, with a thick coat of
fine hair, which lies in short curls, glossy
and silken. He has a well-formed head,
and a handsome, dark eye, full of kindness
and intelligence. His limbs are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
small, and his feet particularly delicate.
He is, I am sorry to say, rather indolent
in his habits, always prefers to take a
carriage to the hunting-ground, when he
goes sporting with his master, and he
sleeps rather too soundly at night to be a
good watch-dog. We make him useful in
various ways, however, such as carrying
baskets and bundles, and sometimes we
send him to the post-office with and for
letters and papers. These he always takes
the most faithful care of, never allowing
any one to look at them on the way. He
is a remarkably gentlemanly dog in his
manner, never making free with people,
or seeming too fond at first sight; but if
you speak to him pleasantly, he will offer
you a friendly paw in a quiet way, and
seem happy to make your acquaintance.
He never fawns, nor whines, nor skulks
about, but is dignified, easy, and perfectly
at home in polite society. He is a sad
aristocrat, treats all well-dressed comers
most courteously, but with shabby people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
he will have nothing to do. Tom knows
how to take and carry on a joke. I recollect
one evening, when we had visitors,
and he was in the parlour, I put on him a
gay-colored sack of my own, and a large
gypsy hat, which I tied under his throat.
Instead of looking ashamed and trying to
get these off, as most dogs would have
done, he crossed the room and sprang on
to the sofa, where he sat upright, looking
very wise and grave, like some old
colored woman at church. The illustrious
General Tom Thumb once travelled with
my brother and this dog, and, falling very
much in love with his namesake, offered
any price for him. Of course, my brother
would not think for a moment of selling
his faithful friend, and even had he felt
differently, I doubt very much whether
Tom, who had been used to looking up to
full-grown men, would have shown much
obedience or respect, for such a funny little
fellow as the General. It was amusing
to observe the dog’s manner toward his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
small, new acquaintance. He was kind
and condescending, though he sometimes
seemed to think that the General was a
little too much inclined to take liberties
with his superiors in age and size,—rather
more forward and familiar than was
quite becoming in a child.</p>

<p>Two or three years ago, Tom was the
beloved playfellow of my brother Frederic’s
youngest daughter,—our little Jane.
She always seemed to me like a fairy-child,
she was so small and delicate, with
such bright golden curls falling about her
face,—the sweetest face in the world. It
was beautiful to see her at play with that
great, black dog, who was very tender with
her, for he seemed to know that she was
not strong. One evening she left her
play earlier than usual, and went and laid
her head in her mother’s lap, and said,
“Little Jane is tired.” That night she
sickened, and in a few, a very few days
she died. When she was hid away in the
grave, we grieved deeply that we should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
see her face no more, but we had joy to
know that it would never be pale with
sickness in that heavenly home to which
she had gone; and though we miss her
still, we have great happiness in the
thought that she will never be “tired”
any more, for we believe her to be resting
on the bosom of the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p>One day last spring, I remember, her
mother gave me a bunch of violets, saying,
“They are from the grave of little
Jane.” I suppose they were like all other
blue violets, but I thought then I had
never seen any so beautiful. It seemed to
me that the sweet looks of the child were
blooming out of the flowers which had
sprung up over the place where we had
laid her.</p>

<p>Tom seems much attached to all our
family, but most devotedly so to my brother
Albert. They two have hunted very much
together, and seem equally fond of the
sport. If Tom sees his master with his
hunting-dress on, and his fowling-piece in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
hand, he is half beside himself with joy.
But when he returns from the hunt, spent
and weary, he always comes to me to be
fed and petted.</p>

<p>You will remember that years have
passed by since this brother and I were
schoolmates and playmates together. He
is now a fine young man, while I am a
full-grown woman, who have seen the
world I used to think so grand and glorious,
and found it—no better than it
should be. But of my brother. He is
our youngest, you know, and so has never
outgrown that peculiar fondness, that
dear love, we always give to “the baby.”
While I have been writing these histories,
and recalling in almost every scene the
playmate of my childhood, I can only see
him as a boy,—a little black-eyed, rosy-cheeked
boy; it is very difficult to think
of him as a <i>man</i>, making his own way
bravely in the world. Last spring we observed
that dear Albert’s bright face had
become very thoughtful and serious; we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
knew that something was weighing on his
mind, and finally it came out. He was
about to leave us all for a long time, it
might be for ever; <i>he was going to California</i>!
We were very unhappy to hear this,
but, as it was on some accounts the best
thing that my brother could do, we finally
consented, and all went to work as cheerfully
as we could to help him off.</p>

<p>It was a bright May morning when he
left, but it seemed to us that there never
was a darker or sadder day. The dear
fellow kept up good courage till it came
to the parting; then his heart seemed to
melt and flow out in his tears, fast dropping
on the brows and necks of his mother
and sisters, as he held them for the last
time to his heaving breast. But I will not
dwell on this parting, for my own eyes
grow so dim I cannot well see to write.</p>

<p>I remember that poor Tom seemed
greatly troubled that morning; he knew
that something sad was happening, and
looked anxiously in our faces, as though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
he would ask what it was; and when my
brother patted him on the head, bade him
good by, and passed out of the gate, forbidding
him to follow, the faithful creature
whined sadly, and looked after him wistfully,
till he was out of sight.</p>

<p>After Albert had been gone about an
hour, I remember that I went up into his
room, and sat down in his favorite seat,
by the window. O, how still and lonely
and mournful it seemed there! Near
me hung my brother’s fencing-sword and
mask, which he had used only the day
before,—on the floor lay the game-bag,
which he had always worn in hunting, and
which he had flung out of his trunk, not
having room for it. This brought my
merry brother before me more clearly than
any thing else. I took it up and held it a
long time, mourning at heart, but I could
not weep. Suddenly I heard a low whine
in the hall, and Tom stole softly into the
room. He came to me and laid his head
in my lap; but when he saw the game-bag<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
there, he set up a most mournful cry.
Then I flung my arms about him, bowed
my head down against his neck, and burst
into tears. I forgot that he was a poor
dumb brute, and only remembered that
he loved my brother, and my brother loved
him, and that he mourned with me in my
sorrow. After this, it was very affecting
to see Tom go every day, for a long while,
to the gate, out of which he had seen his
master pass for the last time, and then
stand and look up the street, crying like
a grieved child.</p>

<p>As you will readily believe, Tom is now
dearer than ever to us all; we cannot see
him without a sweet, sad thought of that
beloved one so far away. I am not now
at home, but I never hear from there without
hearing of the welfare of the noble
dog which my brother, in going, bestowed
upon me.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">FIDO THE BRAVE.</h2>
</div>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_p017.jpg" alt="decorative line"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">First</span> I must relate the somewhat
tragical history of a certain little shaggy
brown-and-white spaniel belonging to
some friends of ours in the country. He
was a stray dog, and came to them in a
very forlorn condition, and had evidently
been vagabondizing about in the fields
and woods for some days, for he was ravenously
hungry, and his long hair was
dirty, and stuck full of straws, briers, and
burrs, till he bristled like a hedgehog.
The first thing that the kind lady did,
after feeding him, was to put him into a
warm bath. Then she set herself to
work to rid him of his encumbrances,—sticks,
straws, briers, and burrs. It was a
long time before she got down to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
dog; but when at last she laid down
scissors, scrubbing-brush, and comb, and
deposited her poor <i>protégé</i> on the floor,
he was a good deal diminished in size,
but looked really handsome, and very
bright, quaint, and droll.</p>

<p>He took at once to his new home, and
soon became a great pet, showing himself
to be grateful, affectionate, and full
of cleverness, fun, and fire. His pluck
was beyond all question. Though not
quarrelsome, he would, when in the least
degree put upon, fight any dog in the
neighborhood, whatever his size and
breed, and he generally came off victorious.
But he was altogether too rash and
venturesome, given to worrying cows,
horses, hogs, and old stragglers; rushing
into all sorts of danger, and coming out,
when he did come out, and was not
brought out, with his little eyes dancing
and his bushy tail in air, as though enjoying
the risk of the thing, and the terror
of his kind mistress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>Among other sportive tricks was a way
he had of running before the locomotive
when the train was coming in or going
out of the station, near by the house of
my friends. Nearly every day he could
be seen frisking about it, dancing frantically
up and down before it, and barking
valorously. He really seemed to take a
malicious satisfaction in defying and insulting
that rumbling, puffing, snorting
monster, that, big as it was, ran away
from him as fast as possible.</p>

<p>“The pitcher goes often to the well,
but is broken at last.”</p>

<p>One fatal day the little spaniel miscalculated
the speed of his big enemy, and
failed to get out of the way in time. He
was all off the track but one hind leg,
when he was struck by the locomotive and
knocked into a ditch,—that one hind
leg being pretty badly mashed, you may
believe. The poor little fellow set up a
great outcry, but the unfeeling engineer
never stopped the train to attend to him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
and the railroad folks kept the accident
out of the papers. Fido made his way
home all alone, dragging his mashed leg
behind him. Though greatly shocked,
his mistress did not scold him, but sent
for a surgeon, who, after a careful examination,
and consulting his books, decided
that an amputation was necessary. Then
the good, brave lady held her poor, dear
pet on her lap while the dreadful operation
was performed. She asked a gentleman
of the family to hold him, but he
had not the nerve. After the stump had
been skilfully dressed, the little dog evidently
felt better, soon ceased to bemoan
his loss, and took kindly to a light supper.
He rested well that night, and in
the morning the doctor pronounced him
better. His kind mistress nursed him
faithfully till he was restored to perfect
health. He never seemed to fret about
his maimed condition, but hopped around
on three legs as merry and active as ever.
It was observed, however, that he gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
a wide berth to railway trains, and howled
whenever he heard the whistle of the
engine, ever after. Still the fight wasn’t
out of him. He was as jealous of his
honor and as fiery and plucky as before
his disaster.</p>

<p>One afternoon, while taking a quiet
three-legged stroll some distance away
from home, he encountered on the highway
a big, surly bull-dog, who presumed
on the spaniel’s diminutive size and crippled
condition to insult him and rail at
him. Brave Fido dashed at once at the
ugly bully’s throat, and bit and hung on
in the most furious and desperate way.
It was a gallant fight he made, and it did
seem for a while as though he must come
off victorious, like David after his engagement
with Goliah. But at last the infuriated
bull-dog tore himself free, and then
proceeded to make mince-meat of the
poor spaniel. He tore his ears half off,
and his eyes half out, and mangled his
head generally, till it was disfigured to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
the last degree. Then he bit and chewed
the left, the only <i>left</i> hind leg, till one
might say that he was next to a locomotive
and a whole train of cars at the
mangling business. At this desperate
stage of the combat a woman came out
of a farm-house near by, drove the bull-dog
away with a poker, and took up poor
Fido. As he had become insensible, she
thought him dead, and flung him down
in a fence corner, out of the way of travel,
and there left him, meaning, let us hope,
to have him decently buried in the morning.
But Fido was not yet ready to give
up this life. The cool evening dew revived
him; brought him to his senses, in
part at least. He could not yet see, but,
guided by some mysterious instinct, he
made his sure way, dragging himself by
his <i>fore</i> legs, which were only <i>two</i> you
know, across the fields to his home. His
mistress was awakened in the night by
hearing him scratching and whining at
the door, and made haste to arise and take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
in the poor crippled, blinded, bleeding
creature, who laid himself panting and
moaning at her feet. I hope I need not
tell you that she did not give him up.
She prepared a soft bed for him in an old
basket, washed and dressed his wounds,
and though every body, especially the
doctor, said he must die, that he was as
good as dead then, she was sure she could
fetch him round, and she did fetch him
round amazingly.</p>

<p>But alas! Fido’s troubles were not over,
even when he got so that he could hobble
about on his three legs, and see tolerably
well; for one cold morning, as he lay
curled up in his basket near the kitchen
stove, he was, I grieve to say, terribly
scalded by a careless cook, who spilled a
kettle of hot water over him. Even then
his mistress refused to give him up to die,
but dressed his burns with sweet oil, or
applied a pain-killer, or “Dalley’s Salve,”
and administered Mrs. Winslow’s Soothing
Syrup, perhaps,—anyhow she nursed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
him so skilfully and faithfully that she
fetched him round again. He is no beauty
nowadays, but alive, and alive like to
be. It is my opinion that, like the great
Napoleon, that dog bears a charmed life.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CAT TALES.</h2>
</div>

<hr class="tiny">

<h3 class="nobreak">FAITHFUL GRIMALKIN.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> years ago, when my parents
lived in old Connecticut, my mother had a
pet cat, a pretty graceful creature, frisky
and arch and gay, though clad in sober
gray. She was a favorite with all the
large household, but especially attached
herself to my mother, following her about
everywhere,—“up stairs, down stairs, and
in my lady’s chamber,” accompanying her
in her walks, hiding behind every bush,
and prancing out upon her in a surprising,
not to say startling, manner.</p>

<p>At last she grew out of kittenhood,
laid aside, in a measure, kittenish things,
and became the happiest, fondest, proudest
feline mamma ever beheld. She caressed
and gloated over her little, blind,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
toddling, mewing, miniature tigers in a
perfect ecstasy of maternal delight. Just
at this interesting period of pussy’s life
our family moved from the old place to
a house in the country, about a mile
away. My mother was ill, and was carried
very carefully on a bed from one
sick-room to another. In the hurry,
trouble, and confusion of that time, poor
pussy, who lodged with her family in an
attic, was quite forgotten. But early in
the morning of the first day in the new
house,—a pleasant summer morning,
when all the doors and windows were
open,—as my mother lay on her bed, in
a parlor on the first floor, she saw her cat
walk into the hall and look eagerly around.
The moment the faithful creature caught
sight of her beloved mistress, she came
bounding into the room, across it, and on
to the bed, where she purred and mewed
in a delighted, yet reproachful way, quite
hysterical, licking my mother’s hand and
rubbing up against her cheek in a manner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
that said more plainly than words,
“Ah! my dear madam, didst thou think
to leave thy faithful Grimalkin behind?
Where thou goest, I will go.”</p>

<p>She was taken into the kitchen and
treated to a cup of new milk; but after
a few moments given to rest and refreshment
she disappeared. Yet she went
only to come again in the course of an
hour, lugging one of her kittens, which
she deposited on the bed, commended to
my mother’s care, and straightway departed.
In an almost incredibly short
time she came bounding in with a second
kitten. She continued her journeys till
the whole litter had been safely transported,
over hill and dale, ditches and
stone-walls, through perils of unfriendly
dogs and mischievous boys, and the family
flitting was complete.</p>

<p>After this, our noble puss was loved
and respected more than ever. She dwelt
long in the land, and her kits grew up, I
believe, to be worthy of such a mother.</p>
<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">OBEDIENT THOMAS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Now</span> I want to give you an instance
of filial respect and submission in a young
cat. When we first came to Washington,
nearly two years ago, I took to petting a
handsome cat belonging to the relatives
with whom we then lived. I fed and
caressed her, and she became very fond
of me, always running to meet me when
I entered the garden which she haunted,
or the barn in which she lodged. She
was rather wild in her ways, and so stole
a nest, in which she finally hid away some
kittens, that she afterwards reared to be
wilder than herself. These somehow disappeared,
all but one, which, when he
was about half grown, I undertook to
tame. It was a difficult, tedious job; but
I persevered, and at last found him a
more affectionate, docile pet than ever his
mother had been. She had seemed fond
of him in his wild, unregenerate days,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
but as soon as he became domesticated,
and I began to show a partiality for him,
she grew very severe with him, scratching
his face and boxing his ears whenever
she saw me caressing him. I soon
noticed that when she was near he was
shy, pretending not to be on intimate
terms with me; while, if she was out of
the way, I had only to call his name, to
have him come galloping up from the
furthest part of the long garden, to rub
against me, to lick my hand, and show
every feline fondness and delight. Now
we live at another house, and I seldom
see my pets, mother and son; but they
are loving and constant still, proving that
the poet Coleridge didn’t know every thing
when he talked about “the little
short memories” of cats.</p>

<p>Master Thomas has grown large and
strong, and is accounted a gallant young
fellow by all the young pussies in the
neighborhood. But while toward cats of
his own sex he is fierce and combative,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
he is just as meek and deferential to his
mother as he was in his tender kittenhood.
The other day I encountered him
in the old garden, and was surprised to
find how stalwart he had become. I
stooped to caress him, and he seemed as
susceptible to gentle overtures as ever,
arched his back, switched his tail, and
purred rapturously. Suddenly the mother
cat stole out from behind a tree, and
confronted us. “Good morning, madam,”
I said, for I always talk to cats and dogs
just as I talk to other people. “You
have a fine son here; a handsome young
fellow, that favors you, I think.” But
she wasn’t to be softened by the compliment.
She walked straight up to him,
and boxed him first on one ear and then
on the other, quite in the old motherly
way. As for him he never thought of
resenting the old lady’s act, or opposing
her will, but drooped his lordly tail, and
hastily retreated. Now that is what I
call good family discipline.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>This city of Washington is a place
where the wits of people are sharpened,
if anywhere, and perhaps even cats and
dogs become uncommonly clever and
knowing here. Only yesterday I was told
of a Washington cat which had just been
found out in a wonderful trick. Observing
that, when the door-bell rang, the one
servant of the household was obliged to
leave the kitchen, she managed to slyly
ring the bell, by jumping up against the
wire, and invariably, when her enemy,
the cook, went to the door, she would
slip into the kitchen, and help herself to
whatever tempting article of food was
within reach. At last some one watched,
and caught her at her secret “wire-pulling.”
Poor puss retired with a drooping
tail and a most dejected aspect, evidently
realizing that the game was up.</p>

<p>Another cat I know of was of so
amiable and benevolent a disposition
that she actually adopted into her own
circle of infant kits a poor, forlorn little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
foundling of a <i>rat</i>. As her nursling he
grew and thrived, seeming quite as tame
as the others; and when a mischievous boy
set a rat-terrier on him, and so finished
him, cat and kittens really seemed to
mourn for their foster son and brother.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<h3 class="nobreak">KATRINA AND KATINKA.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> on a time—no matter when—in
a certain beautiful city—no matter
where—there lived two lovely twin sisters,
with the brightest eyes, and the cunningest
little roly-poly figures, and the
slenderest ears with the softest pink satin
lining, and the spryest motions imaginable.
They were brunettes in complexion,
with white breasts and tail-tips, and they
were kittens. Katrina and Katinka
were their names, if I remember rightly,—maybe
I don’t, but anyhow they <i>might</i>
have had those names, which, to my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
thinking, are very pretty and appropriate
for kittens.</p>

<p>Well, these same twin pussies were singularly
fond of each other, and more singularly
good to each other. They never
called names, or scratched, or spat in
each other’s pretty faces, or pulled each
other’s little smellers, or quarrelled over
their meals. They were so marvellously
alike that it was always difficult to tell
them apart; and when they slept, as
they always did, hugged close in each
other’s arms, you couldn’t have told to
save you where one kitten left off and
the other kitten began.</p>

<p>They not only slept, ate, and played
together, but, as they grew older, took
their strolls for health and recreation and
their mouse-hunts in the same close and
loving companionship. They were very
curious and wide-awake little bodies, and
liked to see all they could of the great,
busy world; so every pleasant afternoon,
when there was much driving and walking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
up and down the fine street on which
they lived, they could be seen strolling
down the long walk to the gate, always
exactly side by side,—“neck and neck,”
as the horse people say,—as even in their
pace, and as perfectly matched in their
action, as ever were a pair of trained ponies
in Hyde Park. Reaching the gate,
they would pause and stand quite still
for a half-hour or so, gravely gazing
through the palings at the passers,—pedestrians,
equestrians, and drivers of
fast horses,—like a pair of dear little brigadiers
reviewing their brigades marching
by. Then, with the air of having discharged
a public duty to the entire satisfaction
of the community, they would
wheel exactly together, and again, precisely
neck and neck and tail and tail,
trot gently homeward.</p>

<p>So they lived on, in and for each other,
almost as much united as if they had
been a pair of small feline female Siamese
twins, amiable, loving, and virtuous,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
and grew in knowledge and stature up to
a comely young cathood. At last it happened
that a very interesting event occurred
to the twin sisters at precisely
the same time,—they became happy
mothers, were blessed with three or
four fine kittens apiece. But alas! before
the little strangers had got fairly to
feel their legs, before they had got
their eyes open, all save one mysteriously
disappeared from each nest. It
was one fatal morning when the twin
sisters had slipped out of their happy
attic apartment for a little air,—to take
their “Constitutional” in a trot down the
long gravel walk to see how the world
would look to them now they were mothers,—that
this kit-napping occurred.
When they returned to their families,
they found them strangely thinned out;
but they were mothers for all that, and
did not seem to fret much, or abate their
maternal pride a jot.</p>

<p>You see the ruling power in the human<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
household in which they were domesticated,
and who was to them as a providence,
had ordered a little hydropathy for
their poor, feeble, sprawling, blind darlings,—beginning
with what is called in
water-cures “the heroic treatment,” a
cold plunge; and it didn’t agree with
them,—it never does with any but the
healthy and hardy patients,—so it was
they never came back. But under the
blue waves they sleep well, though never
a mew or a purr comes bubbling up to the
surface to tell the spot where they lie on
beds of tangled sea-grass. “<i>Requies-cat
in pace</i>,” as old tombstones say.</p>

<p>The next mournful event in this true
family history was the untimely death of
Katrina’s one darling. This had proved
to be but a frail flower of kittenhood;
very pretty she was,—“too sweet to
live,” people said. Her constitution was
defective, her nervous system was extremely
delicate. Before she was a week
old she had something alarmingly like a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
fit of <i>cat</i>alepsy. Suddenly, while imbibing
nourishment, with her fond mother
purring over her, and two or three children
looking on in smiling sympathy, she
gave a piteous wild mew, rolled over on
her back, and stuck up her four little legs
and laid out her little tail stiff as a poker!
On the ninth day of her little life she
opened her blinking blue eyes on this
great wonderful world, in which she had
as good a right to be as you or I; but
she didn’t seem to like the looks of
things, for she soon closed those small
eyes again, and never opened them more.
Life was evidently too hard a conundrum
for her poor, weak little brain, and she
gave it up.</p>

<p>Of course Katrina was greatly afflicted,
but she did not abandon herself utterly
to grief. Had not her sister a kitten
left? and had not they two always had
every thing in common? So as soon as
the sympathetic children had buried her
dead out of her sight under a lilac-bush,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
she went straightway to Katinka, and,
with her full consent, began to divide
with her the duties and joys of maternity.
All three just cuddled down together
in one nest; from mamma or auntie
Master Catkin took nourishment, just as
it suited his whim or convenience, and, as
you might suppose, he grew and thrived
astonishingly. So equal and perfect was
this partnership in the kitten, that it was
impossible for a stranger to tell which of
the two cats was the real mother. One
day all three were brought down to the
parlor to amuse some visitors. Both
mammas seemed equally nervous about
having the baby kitten handled, and
presently one of them caught it by the
neck,—the cat’s usual, immemorial way
of transporting her young,—and started
with it for the attic; when, to the surprise
and immense amusement of all present,
the other caught hold of the tail, and so
the two bore it away in triumph.</p>

<p>After this I am afraid the children gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
the little kitten rather more travelling
than he liked. It was such fun to see
the two anxious cats following him, mewing,
and at the first chance catching him
up, and lugging him home in that absurd
manner. Generally the real certain true
mother seized on the head, but sometimes
she was magnanimous enough to
yield the post of honor to the aunt, and
take to the tail herself.</p>

<p>So things went on for a few weeks, and
then there happened to this estimable
cat-family another sad event,—for this is
a tragedy I am writing, though you may
not have suspected it,—Katinka died!
What of has never yet been decided;
physicians differed about it, and the coroner
could not make it out. But this
much is certain, Katinka died. The grief
of Katrina was and is very affecting to
behold. She mopes, she mews, and her
slender tail, which she used to carry erect
with such a jaunty air, droops dolefully.
She takes no longer the “Constitutional”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
trot down the walk to the front gate.
Life seems to have grown dull and wearisome
to her, and the pleasures of mouse-hunting
and tree-climbing appear to have
lost their zest. If she remembers at all
the halcyon period when much of her precious
time was spent in a dizzy round of
gayety, in a swift pursuit of a ball of cotton,
or a futile pursuit of her own tail, it
is in sad wonder that she could ever have
been so merry and thoughtless. She
grows thin, neglects her toilet, and often
refuses food; but when the children offer
her catnip, she turns languidly away.
If she were acquainted with Shakespeare,
she would doubtless say,—“<i>Canst
thou minister to a mind diseased?</i>” “<i>Throw
physic to Bose and Jowler,—I’ll none of
it!</i>”</p>

<p>Friendly cat-neighbors call in occasionally,
but they cannot console her. All
the petting of the household fails thus
far to make her cheery and playful as
once she was. She is fed on the very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
“milk of human kindness,” but grief has
licked the cream off.</p>

<p>She seems to find her only consolation
in her care and affection for the motherless
catkin, and in his fondness for her.
I am sorry to say that he does not show
a very deep sense of his loss; perhaps
he is too young to realize it. His good
aunt seems sufficient for all his needs, and
he thrives finely, is fat and jolly, and full
of all kittenish pranks and mischievous
tricks. Poor Katrina will have a time
with him, I fear, as he is sadly petted and
indulged. Such a lazy rascal as he is too,—don’t
earn the salt of his porridge,
that is, if he took it salted,—and, though
quite old enough to “go on the war path,”
has never yet killed his mouse, or brought
home a rat’s scalp, or a ground-squirrel’s
brush, or as much as a feather from a tomtit’s
wing. Ah! of all the darlings in the
world, an aunty’s darling is the likeliest
to be spoiled.</p>

<p>This is all I know about this curious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
cat-family. I hope, dear children, that
my true story may not sadden you, for I
really wish you, one and all, the merriest
of merry Christmases, and the happiest
of happy New Years.</p>

<p>All I can say in the way of a moral to
my little story is: How beautiful is
love! even when shown in the fortunes
and sorrows of cats and kittens, how
beautiful is love!</p>

<hr class="tiny">
<h3 class="nobreak">OUR COUSINS THE PARROTS.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">These</span> strangely interesting birds, according
to natural history, belong to the
second bird family, the <i>Psittacidæ</i>. I never
knew how many wonderful and splendid
varieties this family contained until I
saw living varieties of all, or nearly all,
in the known world, in the Zoölogical
Gardens of London, where they are kept
in a great gallery,—a beautiful parrot
paradise, all by themselves. They were
a wonder to behold, but a perfect astonishment
to listen to. The confusion of
tongues was something almost distracting.
The Tower of Babel, in its talkingest
day, never approached it, I am sure.
A large sewing-circle of elderly ladies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
might come nearer the mark. The colors
of their plumage I have no words to
describe. They fill my memory with tropic
splendors whenever I think of them,
to this day.</p>

<p>’Tis strange that but one species of
parrots was known to the ancient Greeks
and Romans,—the Parakeet of India,—at
least up to the time of Nero. That
gentle prince, with his amiable love of
pets, is said to have sent emissaries far up
the Nile to collect new varieties for the
gratification of his royal whim and dainty
appetite; for, when the poor little captives
ceased to amuse him by their conversational
powers, he ate them. I hope
they lay hard on his stomach, and made
him talk in his sleep!</p>

<p>The early Portuguese navigators found
parrots at the Cape of Good Hope, and
at other points on the African coast; and
the very first creatures that welcomed
Columbus to the isles of the New World
were Parakeets. The Macaws of South<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
America are very handsome birds, but
not remarkably tractable or agreeable.
They are fond of old friends, but are
fierce to strangers, and have a singular
dislike to children. The gray and scarlet
parrot, called the Yaco, is a charming
bird for a pet. It is clever and docile,
and learns readily to talk, preferring
to imitate the voices of children. The
Cockatoos of New Guinea are very pretty
and graceful pets. They do not like to
be caged, but may be safely allowed to
have the range of the premises, as they
will immediately come when called; thus
setting an excellent example to rebellious
children. The green parrot, most common
in this country, is a native of Africa.</p>

<p>Dear old Dr. Goldsmith, whose Natural
History is all out of fashion now, except
with us old folks, tells some amusing stories
about parrots. Among these is an
anecdote of a famous fellow, belonging
to King Henry the Seventh, Queen Elizabeth’s
grandfather. This bird, sitting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
on his perch in the palace-yard at Westminster,
used to hear the talk of gentlemen
who came to the river to take boats.
And one day, while overlooking the busy
traffic of the Thames, he fell from a tree
into the water; and while there, floating
helplessly, he cried: “A boat! twenty
pounds for a boat!” A waterman rescued
him, and took him to the king, demanding
his twenty pounds. The king,
who was not remarkably generous, hesitated
about giving so large a sum; but
finally agreed to leave the amount of the
reward to the parrot. That ungrateful
fellow, who sat on his perch, still shaking
the water from his feathers, when appealed
to, turned his head slyly on one
side, and said, “Give the knave a groat”
(about fourpence). I hope, children, you
won’t doubt the truth of this story; it
isn’t good to get into sceptical habits of
mind in early life.</p>

<p>For many years there lived in the porter’s
lodge of the old Pennsylvania Hospital<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
a distinguished and venerable citizen,—a
parrot of rare cleverness and intelligence.
This famous bird belonged to the
porter, and was one of many feathered
pets, the chief favorite and familiar. A
remarkable affection and sympathy existed
between these two friends; yet I am
sorry to say their relations were not altogether
pleasant and peaceful. Innumerable
were their quarrels and make-ups.
The bird was very knowing, and almost
supernaturally gifted as a talker, especially,
like some human orators, in the
language of railing and taunting. The
old man, his master, had one deplorable
weakness,—he would occasionally drink
too much whiskey; so much that, getting
quite beside himself, he would leave his
lodge and his innocent feathered family,
and go off on a desperate spree, which
sometimes lasted for days. Now, Master
Paul Parrot thought this weakness,
through which he suffered in loneliness
and neglect, very reprehensible and not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
to be winked at, and when the fit of dissipation
was coming on his master, it is
said, would remonstrate with him, in a
friendly way, like a very Mentor. When
this proved in vain, and he saw the misguided
old man leave the lodge for some
of his disreputable haunts, he would endeavor
to put a good face on the matter,
would hop about on his perch in great
excitement, and call out to the other
birds: “The old man has gone on a
spree!—on a spree! He won’t be back
for a week! Let’s have a time. Ha,
ha!”</p>

<p>When the old porter came home, this
naughty bird would be very apt to mock
and taunt him, calling out: “So you’ve
come back,—have you? O, how drunk
you are! Now we’ll have a row.” And
there always was a row; for the indignant
porter never failed to beat Mr. Paul,
for his impudence, soundly. Then the
bird, seeking the dignified retirement of
the darkest corner of the lodge, sulked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
and muttered, till, the old porter’s good-humor
returning, he made friendly overtures.
The two were reconciled, and
“every thing was lovely” again.</p>

<p>At length the poor old porter died;
and as his successor was no bird-fancier
the feathered family at the lodge was
broken up and dispersed. The clever
parrot was kindly treated in a new home;
but he never seemed happy. He evidently
missed his old master,—missed
his caresses and his scoldings. Or perhaps
he found the steady goings-on of a
moral household too dull for his taste, for
when I went to see him, I found him as
glum, stupid, and morose as an old politician
who had had his day. All he would
say was, “O you goose!”</p>

<p>There is another curious parrot in Philadelphia,
in a store kept by a maiden
lady whose voice is so exceeding shrill
and parrot-like that it is difficult to tell
when she leaves off talking and the parrot
begins. One day, as a customer was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
examining an article on the counter, Miss
Polly called out: “What are you doing
with that? Put it down! put it down!”
The lady looked round very indignantly
for the offender, saying: “Well, ma’am,
I must say you have a very impudent
child.”</p>

<p>There is in the same city another parrot,
who recites a verse of an old song
in a most distinct and triumphant manner:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“O pretty Polly,</div>
<div class="indent">Don’t you cry,</div>
<div class="verse">For your true-love</div>
<div class="indent">Will come by and by.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>There is in Brooklyn, New York, a parrot
that sings many of the popular airs
correctly, and with as much expression as
many fashionable singers give to them.
This bird is singularly social and affectionate,
and has a horror of being alone.
He will sometimes awake in the middle
of the night, and arouse the household
by crying: “O dear! I am all alone!—all
alone! Somebody come to me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>I have heard much of a clever parrot
once kept by some relatives of ours on an
old place in a quiet little village. Mistress
Polly had free range of the house
and yard, and throughout the town was
as well known as the oldest inhabitant.
Through all the pleasant weather she
haunted the tall trees in front of the
house, climbing to the highest branches,
and from there superintending the affairs
of the neighborhood, and making astronomical
and meteorological observations.
In the spring and autumn she watched
from these lofty perches the flight of
great flocks of pigeons and crows with
intense but decidedly unfriendly interest.
She would scream and scold at
them in a most insolent and defiant manner,
evidently criticising the order of
their march and all their manœuvres and
evolutions, for all the world like a newspaper
editor finding fault with the conduct
of great armies. Doubtless she was
astonished and disgusted to see the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
host sweep steadily on, following their
leader, paying no heed to her shrieking,
railing, and evil prophecies. Yet she was
never so absorbed by her duties on the
watch-tower that she failed to come to
her meals. These she took with the family,
perched on the back of a chair or the
corner of the table. She was very fond
of coffee, and was always provided with
a cup. She would take it up by the handle
with her claws, and drink from it
without spilling a drop. A terrible gossip
and busybody was she, talking perpetually
and doing all the mischief that lay
in her power. She was the terror and
torment of all cats and kittens; for, wary
and watchful as they might be, Polly was
always surprising them by attacks in the
rear, and cunning ambuscades and flank
movements. Nothing more still and soft-footed
could be imagined than her approaches;
nothing more sly, sudden, and
sharp than the nips she gave with her
horrid hooked bill. A cat’s extended tail<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
was especially tempting to her. She generally
fought the battle out on that line.
“In maiden meditation fancy free,” this
parrot roamed about the yard, and laughed
and railed at patient sitting hens, and the
proud mothers of newly hatched chicks
and ducklings. Sometimes she would
follow a brood about, sneering and advising,
until the poor mother was in an agony
of worriment. At last she came to
grief in this way. A spirited speckled
hen, with a fine brood of young ones,
tired of being snubbed and of hearing
her offspring depreciated, and shocked at
seeing the domestic virtues set at naught
by a flaunting foreign fowl of infidel sentiments,
turned upon her, sprang upon
her back, and began pecking and tearing
at her sleek plumage like mad! The
feathers fell all around, like a shower of
green snow; and the parrot began screaming
with all her might: “Let up! Let
up! Poor Polly! Poor Polly!”</p>

<p>Her mistress came to the rescue, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
Polly skulked away to her cage, where she
remained several days, sullen and deeply
humiliated; but when she emerged from
her retirement she gave the hens and
chickens a wide berth.</p>

<p>Several parrots, the pets and companions
of religious persons, have been distinguished
by their piety, or what passed
for such. These have usually belonged
to devout Catholics. I have read of one,
named <i>Vert-Vert</i>,—the inmate of a convent
in France, and taught by the holy
nuns,—who was esteemed a most blessed
and miraculously gifted bird. His fame
spread far and wide. Many made pilgrimages
to the convent to be edified by
his pious exhortations; and at last the
nuns of another convent, in a distant
province, solicited the loan of him for a
few months, for the good of their souls.
He went forth as a sort of feathered apostle,
followed by the prayers and blessings
of the bereaved sisters, and looking very
solemn and important. But, unfortunately,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
on his journey, he was compelled to
spend a night on a steamer; and being
kept awake by such new scenes, and perhaps
a little sea-sickness, he listened too
much to the unprofitable and profane talk
of the sailors and some soldiers who were
on board. And so it happened that, when
he reached the convent, where he was
received with great joy and impressive
religious ceremonies, instead of edifying
the good sisters with exhortations and
chants, delivered in a grave, decorous
manner, he horrified them by shouting
like a rough old sea-captain and swearing
like a major-general, while he assumed
the most knowing, rollicking air imaginable.
Those saintly women stopped their
ears, and fled from him as though he had
been a demon-bird, and he was immediately
sent home in utter disgrace. There,
through fasts and penances, he was
brought round to more correct habits and
behavior; but he never became the shining
light he had been before his sudden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
fall. No more pilgrimages were made to
his perch. Though grown a sadder and
a wiser bird, it was impossible to tell
whether he most sorrowed for his fault
or regretted the wicked world of which
he had had a taste. Still he made a good
end, I believe, within the convent’s hallowed
cloisters.</p>

<p>A certain pious cardinal in Rome once
gave a hundred crowns in gold for a parrot
that could repeat the Apostles’ Creed.
Another religiously trained parrot once
served as a chaplain on board of a ship,—actually
reciting the service for the sailors,
who listened and responded with becoming
solemnity. I have never seen a
clerical parrot; but I have seen clergymen
who suggested parrots. By the way,
the parrot would make a very economical
sort of minister. After the first cost of
the bird, his education, and a respectable
cage or parsonage, there would be no demands
on the congregation for increase
of salary. As he would have no scruples<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
about repeating old sermons, he would
not desire new fields of labor. Parrots
seldom have any family, so he would
expect no donation-parties. They never
have dyspepsia, so he would require no
trips to Europe. He would not, I fear,
be very popular in the sewing-circles and
Dorcas societies,—for he would talk
down all the ladies.</p>

<p>A dear young friend of ours has a lovely
pair of turtle-doves, that are constantly
making love to each other, these soft
spring days, in that delicious, drowsy
honey-moon coo, “most musical, most
melancholy.”</p>

<p>Awhile ago the disastrous experiment
was tried, of putting these doves into the
cage with a parrot. Miss Polly did not
fancy her dainty visitors in the least.
She glared at them as they cuddled together
in a corner, eying her askance,
and murmuring in the sweet dove dialect,—Madame<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
Columba very timidly,
and Monsieur in a tender, reassuring tone.
Miss Polly abominated such soft, love-sick
voices, and such a parade of matrimonial
bliss and affection just exasperated
her; so she pitched into them, scolding
fearfully at first, but soon coming to
blows with her wings, then to scratching
and pecking with her steel-like claws and
fearful, hooked bill. When the hapless
pair were rescued, it was found that the
husband, who had fought gallantly to
protect his wife, had met with a serious
loss, in the upper part of his bill, which
had been quite bitten off by that inhospitable
old termagant, who had doubtless
thought thus to put an end to his billing
and cooing.</p>

<p>The poor fellow lost some glossy feathers
in this encounter. They have been
replaced, but the broken beak has never
been restored. Thus maimed, he is only
able to drink from a perfectly full cup,
and his loving mate invariably stands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
back till his thirst is satisfied. She also
feeds him when he has difficulty in eating,
and always carefully plumes him, as
he can no longer perform that service for
himself. Indeed, she attends to his toilet
before her own. No fond wife of a disabled
soldier could surpass her in watchful
care and devotion. What a touching
little lesson is this, of tender, faithful
love! I wonder if he would have done
as much for her. Let us hope so.</p>

rooster, once belonging to a relative of
ours in the West. This fowl was old, but
he was tender; he was ugly, but he was
virtuous, as you shall see. One of the
hens of his flock died suddenly and mysteriously,—of
too many family cares, perhaps,
for she left a brood of twelve hearty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
clamorous young chickens. One of the
children, the poet of the family, said:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Grandfather Shanghai</div>
<div class="verse">Stood sadly by,</div>
<div class="verse">And saw her die,</div>
<div class="verse">With a tear in his eye.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Perhaps he received her last instructions,—her
dying bequest. If so, never
was a legatee more burdened with responsibilities;
for from that hour the good
rooster adopted all those chickens, and
devoted himself to them. When the
fowls were fed, he guarded their portion;
he watched over them when hawks were
hovering near; he scratched and fought
for them and stalked around after them
all day, and at night, after leading the
other fowls to roost, he would descend
from the old pear-tree, gather those poor
sleepy little things under him, and do his
best to brood them. His legs were so
long and stiff that it was a difficult job.
First he would droop one wing down to
shelter them; then, seeing that they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
exposed on the other side, would let
down the other. Then, finding that he
could not keep both down at once, he
would try to crouch lower, and would
sometimes tip himself entirely over. It
was a laughable sight, I assure you. But
somehow he managed to keep them warm,
to feed them, and bring them up in the
way they should go; and I hope they
always loved him, and never made fun of
their gaunt, ungainly old guardian, when
they grew up, and went among the other
young people of the farm-yard, especially
when chatting with the foreign fowls,
the proud Spanish hens, and the pretty
Dorking pullets.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<h3 class="nobreak">THE GALLANT BANTAM.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> observed that while the Bantam
pullet is a quiet, modest, little pantaletted
lady, the Bantam cockerel always
makes up in big feeling for what he lacks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
in size. A gentleman farmer owned
a Bantam of this sort, that was always
full and bubbling over with fight. He
would go at any gentleman-fowl in the
yard, with beak and spur. He would
defy the fiercest old gander, and challenge
the biggest “cock of the walk” to
mortal combat. At last he grew so uncomfortably
quarrelsome, and presented
such a disreputable appearance,—having
had the best part of his tail-feathers torn
out, and his spurs broken off,—that his
master was obliged to put him out to
board with a nice old lady who had no
fighting fowls for him to contend with.
It was hoped that he would be content
to tarry in that Jericho until his tail-feathers
should be grown; but one day,
when his master paid a visit to his good
neighbor, he found the little Bantam with
his head badly swollen, and with a patch
over one eye and across his beak, placed
there by the kind old lady. He had gone
outside the yard, and picked a quarrel with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
a strange rooster, only about six times
his size, and been pretty badly punished.</p>

<p>A short time after, a big turkey gobbler
was added to the feathered community
of that farm-yard, the old lady not
dreaming of the Bantam cock daring to
make hostile demonstrations against such
a potentate. But she had done our little
hero injustice. As soon as he saw the
mighty spread the arrogant old fellow
was making, he just gathered himself up,
and “went for him,” if I may use a slang
expression, which I know boys, at least,
will understand only too well.</p>

<p>The big gobbler looked down upon him
at first in contemptuous astonishment, as
much as to say, “What fooling is this?”
But when he saw that the fiery little fellow
was in earnest, he just struck him
one blow with his terrible wing, and—well,
the gallant Bantam went “on his
raids no more.” He was served as another
savage Turkey served poor Crete.
This is a world of tragedies and downfalls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>On a late visit to the Central Park, we
noticed, among the collection of fowls
there, a Bantam cock, of the very smallest
pattern, that yet seemed to have a
big, gallant heart. We saw him in one
of his soft moments, when, in fact, he
was making love. He had been very
ambitious in selecting the object of his
adoration, for he was actually paying his
addresses to a full-sized Shanghai hen,
who was in a large cage, separated from
him by a light lattice. He would strut
up and down before her, ruffling his fine
feathers, and making eyes at her. Sometimes
he would dance up sideways, declaring
his passion with a soft, musical
murmur, that sounded like “coort, coort,”
which it would seem she could hardly
resist; but she did,—not so much as a
feather on her breast was stirred by his
appeal; she regarded him in placid disdain.
Indeed, it was almost as funny to
watch the tiny, strutting little creature
making love to that superior fowl, as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
would be to see Commodore Nutt courting
Miss Swan, the giantess.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">THE DISOWNED CHICKS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> a friend living in the very heart
of the big city of Chicago, who owns
several hens of rare varieties, and a flock
of young chickens of remarkable promise.
She keeps them in her back-yard,
which they utterly devastate, not suffering
a green thing to live, making it look
like a small copy of the Desert of Sahara.
Yet she says keeping them reminds her
of the country! She is a very poetic
and imaginative lady. It is very likely
that a hand-organ reminds her of music,
and fish-balls of the mighty, briny deep.</p>

<p>One of this good lady’s hens is a handsome,
stately fowl, dressed in gray satin,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
and wearing a top-knot that is like a
crown of silver. She has one chicken, almost
full-grown,—the last of many lively
children, the victims of rats and the pip.
Of him she is very fond. There was, at
one time, great danger that he would be
spoiled,—for she toiled for him all day,
trotting about everywhere with him “at
her apron-strings,” so to speak; and she
actually broods him at night, though, do
the best she can in spreading herself, she
can’t take in all of his tail, unless she lets
his head stick out somewhere. Thus he
is content to sleep ingloriously, when he
ought to be roosting on some lofty perch,
ready to greet the first streak of dawn
with a brave crow, prophetic of the day.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago another hen, a young
pullet, dressed gayly every day in gold
and brown, with a gorgeous top-knot,
came, one morning, triumphantly out
from under the porch, with a large flock
of charming little chicklings, who toddled
along after her, and glanced up at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
sky, and round on the earth,—that vast
sandy plain of the back-yard,—in a most
knowing and patronizing manner. Nobody
would have guessed it was their first
day out of the shell. They were not going
to show their greenness,—not they.</p>

<p>For a while those downy, yellow, cunning
little roly-poly creatures seemed to
amuse their mother; she appeared fond
of them, taking pleasure in parading them
before such of her neighbors as were
chickenless. But she was a giddy biddy,
lazy and selfish; so, as soon as she found
that she must scratch to fill so many little
crops, she threw up maternity in disgust.
She actually cast off her whole brood,
pecked at them, and scolded them till
they ran from her in fright, and huddled
together in a corner of the fence, peeping
piteously, and doubtless wishing they had
never been hatched. Perhaps some were
chicken-hearted enough to wish for death
to end their troubles, till they caught
sight of some ugly old rat prowling about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
“seeking whom he might devour,” when
they reconsidered the matter, and took a
more cheerful view of life.</p>

<p>Well, it came to pass that the excellent
gray hen, with the one big chicken, seeing
their forlorn condition, pitied them
exceedingly, and actually adopted the
whole flock. Only think, children, it was
as though your mother should adopt a
small orphan asylum, and all of them
twins!</p>

<p>She toils for them and protects them
all day, treating them in all respects as
her own chicks, till sundown; then, not
having room for them under her wings
without dislodging her only son and heir,
she always escorts them up the steps of
the porch and sees them go to bed in a
little box, which has been prepared for
them by their kind mistress, with a cover
of slats to guard them from rats and cats
and bats and owls, and every thing that
prowls or lies in wait for small fowls.
Well, when she has seen the last chick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
tumble in, and cuddle down to its place
with a sleepy good-night “peep,” to be
brooded under the invisible wings of the
soft summer night, that good, motherly
creature descends with stately dignity
from the porch to her own sleeping apartment
underneath, when she mounts on a
box, and, calling her one long-legged darling,
does her best to hover him, and to
make believe he is a baby-chicken still.
In the morning she is astir betimes,
scratching and pecking for him and his
adopted brothers and sisters with wonderful
impartiality. I must do this same
big chicken the justice to say that he has
never made any violent opposition to this
sudden addition to the family; but he
has rather a haughty manner towards the
little interlopers, and could we understand
the sort of Chickasaw language he
speaks, we might find him occasionally
remonstrating with his maternal parent
in this wise: “Really, mother, it strikes
me you are running your benevolence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
into the ground, in scratching your nails
off for a lot of other hen’s chickens! such
things don’t pay, ma’am; charity begins
at home, and one would think you had
enough on your claws, in providing for
the wants of a growing young cockerel
like me, without doing missionary work.
Besides, you are encouraging idleness
and shiftlessness; it just sticks in my
crop to have you burden yourself with the
cast-off responsibilities of that impudent
pullet, who goes cawking lazily about, carrying
her top-knot as high as ever.”</p>

<p>The conduct of that unnatural young
mother is, indeed, reprehensible. At
meal-times she always comes elbowing
her way through the crowd of her virtuous
neighbors, to secure the largest share
of corn-mush, not hesitating to rob her
own children! She will be likely to have
a disturbing and demoralizing influence
on the female feathered community. She
shirks her duties,—declines to lay eggs
lest chickens should come of them. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
believes the chicken population is too
large already for the average supply of
chickweed and grubworms. She discourages
nest-making, and despises her weak-minded
sisters, who, in spite of her warning,
persist in laying, sitting, and hatching;
who really believe in the innocence
of chickenhood, and actually love to
brood their chicks, to feel the soft little
things stir against their breasts, and to
hear now and then, in the still, dark
night, their drowsy “peep, peep.” She
goes against all such silly sentiment and
loving slavery. She pities any poor pullet
who has to spend her days in a coop,
especially in Chicago. She is a sort of
hen-emancipator, and strolls about at
“her own sweet will,” “in maiden meditation,
fancy free.”</p>

<p>If she could have the management of
the hatchway, all chickens would be
hatched with equal rights to wear the
spur, and with equal gifts of crest and
crow; all hatching would be done by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
steam, in a general incubatorium at government
expense, in a way to astonish
all grandmother Biddies; sittings would
be abolished, coops levelled to the earth,
and the sound of the cluck be heard no
more in the land.</p>

<p>As for the poor cast-off chicks, they
grow and thrive, get more steady on their
legs, and put out tiny tail-feathers, tinged
with gold, as the bright summer days go
on. They doubtless think that their first
mother was a mistake, and that their
second mother is the certain true one,
and honor her silver top-knot accordingly.</p>

<p>So you see, dear children, there is a
Providence for little chickens, as well as
for little sparrows.</p>
